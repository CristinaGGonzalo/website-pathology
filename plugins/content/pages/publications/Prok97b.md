## Abstract
The image quality of a radiograph is determined by the local contrast, spatial resolution, latitude and the image noise. The goal of digital processing is to improve the visualisation of pathology by optimising these physical parameters. Processing parameters need to be chosen correctly in order to overcome the inverse relationship between contrast and latitude while producing images that retain a conventional appearance. Unsharp mask filtering (UMF) is a simple technique for improving image quality. This technique, however, suffers from serious drawbacks, such as the suppression of pathologic lesions or artifacts that may simulate pathology. Manufacturers have developed different approaches in order to overcome problems and artifacts derived from this technique.

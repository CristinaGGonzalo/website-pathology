## Abstract
For the in vivo relaxivity of Gd-DTPA at 6.3 T in rat muscle a value of 2.7+/-0.5 (mM s)(-1) was found, and for the in vitro value in water 3.00+/-0.56 (mM s)(-1) at 37 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the in vitro relaxivity was -0.087 (mM s degrees C)(-1). The relation between 1/T1 and the tissue Gd-DTPA concentration is linear for the normally used in vivo Gd-DTPA concentration range.

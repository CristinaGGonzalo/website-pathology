## Abstract
Osteoporosis is a dynamic process, thought to be caused by an uncoupling between osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Altered pulsatile secretion of growth hormone and parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been proposed as pathogenetic factors for this unbalanced coupling. The anatomical lesions are believed to be reversible until trabecular perforations develop, if fractures already occurred the anatomical defect is permanent. It is helpful to classify osteoporosis in stages of increasing severity depending on bone density and the presence of fractures. Theoretically, if the bone density is above the fracture threshold, then the only therapeutic goal is to maintain the bone mass. If instead the mineral density is below the threshold, an active therapy is needed with drugs that can possibly increase the skeletal mass. Osteoporosis with multiple fractures cannot be reversed. The authors propose a promising pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis, based on the combination of human PTH-(1-38) and intranasal salmon calcitonin. If started in the early stages of the osteoporotic process, this regimen may restore the initial bone mass. In more advanced stages, only a correction of the metabolic defect is possible, but the irreversible vertebral deformities are not affected. On the basis of the results, cyclic therapy with human PTH-(1-38) and salmon calcitonin represents a good treatment choice for osteoporosis.

David Tellez graduated in Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Seville in 2014. During his Master's studies he was involved in the Robotics, Vision and Control Research Group as a Research Intern. His Master's Thesis entitled "EEG Signal Processing in Neuromarketing Research" was written involving two international partners: the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and Synetiq Ltd. For almost two years, he worked at Synetiq Ltd as a Research Engineer designing and implementing solutions to model and analyze multimodal physiological data, including EEG, EDA, PPG and eye-tracking. In February 2016, David joined the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group under the supervision of Jeroen van der Laak as a PhD student. He is a recipient of the Junior Research Grant from Radboud Institute for Health Sciences in 2016 with the Thesis title "Deep neural networks to assess the tumour stroma for breast cancer prognostication". This project aims to explore how deep neural networks can be applied to the field of Computational Pathology, with the specific goal of improving breast cancer prognosis.

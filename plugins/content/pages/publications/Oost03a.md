## Abstract
Monoclonal antibody G250 treatment may have a role in the management of metastatic RCC; however, particular subgroups who are more prone to benefit from this treatment must be delineated. High-risk patients may benefit from adjuvant treatment with this nontoxic treatment modality. Large cohort studies are needed to investigate this possibility.

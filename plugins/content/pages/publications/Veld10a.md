## Abstract
Bleeding within the biliary tree, called hemobilia, is a rare complication after blunt hepatic trauma.To report on a patient who developed hemobilia 1 month after a blunt abdominal injury and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of hemobilia.A 17-year-old boy presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by hemobilia 1 month after a blunt liver injury. Angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the right hepatic artery, which was successfully treated with embolization.The diagnosis of hemobilia first requires consideration of the diagnosis, particularly in patients with previous abdominal trauma. Hemobilia should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Investigations of choice include computed tomography scan followed by angiography. During angiography, treatment can be done by endovascular embolization.

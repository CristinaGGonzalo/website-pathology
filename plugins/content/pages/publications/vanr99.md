## Abstract
Two cases with an incidental finding of a widened intervertebral foramen due to extensive tortuosity of the vertebral artery are presented. Computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) both proved to be useful as non-invasive techniques to provide the diagnosis. In-plane saturation is a disadvantage seen with the two-dimensional time-of-flight MRA technique.

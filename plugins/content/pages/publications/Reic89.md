## Abstract
Diagnostic modalities in trauma studies of the foot include conventional radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital projection radiography (DR). Several projections and special views of the conventional radiographic technique are shown with special respect to the hindfoot and the subtalar joint. The importance of ultrasound for soft tissue diagnosis is emphasized. Other modalities (CT, MRI, DR) are illustrated.

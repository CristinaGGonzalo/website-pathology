## Abstract
Malignant tracheo-esophageal fistulae can be palliated with bifurcate tracheal stents. However, stents must be manufactured according to the individual anatomy. In these instances a foam cuff can result in better sealing of the fistulized area. We present a successful implantation of a bifurcate tracheal stent with foam cuff. To facilitate preoperative planning reconstruction possibilities offered by spiral computed tomography were used.

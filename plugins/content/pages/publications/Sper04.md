## Abstract
We describe a 35-year-old man who was initially treated with standard inguinal orchiectomy and prophylactic radiotherapy for Stage I seminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis. We report the case because of the unique nature of the later disease recurrence, which was a solitary cranial bony recurrence that extended both intracranially and extracranially. The patient had complete remission after combined cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

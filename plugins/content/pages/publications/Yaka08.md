## Abstract
To describe the technique of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsy as performed in our institution and highlight trends from current literature.Local protocols for MR prostate cancer localization and its image data analysis are described. Acquisition of a 3-dimensional localization for a tumor suspected region and its reidentification on a second MR-guided biopsy session are explained. Furthermore, detailed information about the procedure, the biopsy technique itself, and the current trends are discussed and highlighted.Magnetic resonance-guided biopsies have a higher tumor detection rate of prostate cancer in patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and repeated negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies. It is a feasible and accurate technique.Performance of MR-guided prostate biopsies, using suggested techniques, protocols, and equipment, is a feasible and accurate technique. It has been proven to be an accurate method for the detection of significant prostate cancer in men with repetitive previous negative biopsies.

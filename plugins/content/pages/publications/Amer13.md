## Abstract
MR angiography is proposed as a safer and less expensive alternative to the reference standard, DSA, in the follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular coil occlusion. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of TOF-MRA and contrast-enhanced MRA in detecting residual flow in the follow-up of coiled intracranial aneurysms. Literature was reviewed through the PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE data bases. In comparison with DSA, the sensitivity of TOF-MRA was 86% (95% CI: 82-89%), with a specificity of 84% (95% CI: 81-88%), for the detection of any recurrent flow. For contrast-enhanced MRA, the sensitivity and specificity were 86% (95% CI: 82-89%) and 89% (95% CI: 85-92%), respectively. Both TOF-MRA and contrast-enhanced MRA are shown to be highly accurate for detection of any recanalization in intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular coil occlusion.

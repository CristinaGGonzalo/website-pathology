## Abstract
Earlier studies have shown that single-energy quantitative computed tomography (SEQCT) is a reliable method for bone mineral density (BMD) measurements in thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Moreover, SEQCT has proved to be a useful parameter in the selection of appropriate implants in cervical spondylodesis. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of SEQCT in cervical vertebrae BMD measurement. BMD with reference to calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10[PO4]6[OH]2) was assessed by SEQCT in 100 human vertebral bodies of the cervical spine. Bone cylinders were then cut from the appropriate region of interest. The cylinder volume was determined by the liquid displacement technique. The density of the mineral component was measured following incineration at 1100 degrees C for 24 h. The calculated BMD was correlated with the SEQCT values, resulting in a coefficient of r = 0.79 (P < 0.01). Mean SEQCT values were significantly lower than those determined by direct density assessment (t-test for coupled sampling, P < 0.02). This result was in agreement with studies on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. These data suggest that SEQCT can reliably measure BMD in the cervical spine.

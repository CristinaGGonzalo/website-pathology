## Abstract
Cardiological and radiological findings in a 64-year-old patient with persistent left superior vena cava and absent right-sided superior vena cava are described. Presence of a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is considered to be one of the most frequent anomalies of the systemic venous return. It occurs most often in association with a right-sided superior vena cava and only in rare cases with an absent or atretic right-sided superior vena cava. This malformation is often associated with other congenital heart defects, but without major hemodynamic significance. The variation may cause difficulties in venous catheterization, pacemaker electrode insertion or during cardiopulmonary bypass. The diagnosis can be confirmed by angiography, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

## Abstract
Breast density measurement in Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is becoming important due to its relation with the risk factor for developing breast cancer. In this work we developed a fully automatic method for the segmentation of fibroglandular tissue. The method consist of a first step based on a Bayesian framework using atlas information for the separation of the pectoral and the breast, and a second refinement stage by LDA. The method was evaluated over 27 cases comparing the obtained segmentations to the manual ones. A Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.75 was obtained.

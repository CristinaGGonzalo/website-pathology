## Abstract
The application of in vivo 13C MR spectroscopy to mouse brain models is potentially valuable for improving the understanding of cerebral carbohydrate metabolism and glutamatergic neurotransmission in various neuropathologies. However, the low sensitivity of 13C nuclei and contaminating signals of lipids in the relatively small mouse brain make this application rather challenging. To meet these technical challenges, localized semi-adiabatic distortionless enhanced polarization transfer (DEPT) MR spectroscopy in combination with a continuous intravenous [1,6-13C2] glucose infusion was implemented to detect glucose metabolism in isoflurane-anesthetized mice at 7T. The signal enhancement and high spectral resolution obtained in these experiments enabled the separate determination of 13C label incorporation into as much as 13 metabolites from a 175 microL volume. Signal increases of glucose (C6), glutamine (C3, C4), and glutamate (C3, C4) were determined with a time resolution of 8.6 min. This study demonstrates an optimized MR method for the application of in vivo 13C MRS in mouse brain.

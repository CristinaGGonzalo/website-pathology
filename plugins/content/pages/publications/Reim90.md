## Abstract
Evaluation of the weight-bearing articular cartilage of the femoral condyles is possible by sonography. Bone and cartilage transplants can be examined by conventional radiological methods combined with sonography. This provides clinically relevant information. Sonography is a cheap imaging method for providing additional information on the post-operative course of cartilage transplants.

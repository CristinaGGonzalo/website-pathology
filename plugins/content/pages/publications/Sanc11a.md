## Abstract
BK virus (BKV) is an increasingly identified cause of pathology in immunocompromised transplant recipients. BKV is a well-known cause of graft dysfunction following renal transplantation and has also been reported in the native kidneys of other solid organ recipients. Less commonly, BKV nephropathy occurs in allogeneic stem-cell transplant (SCT) recipients. We now describe the first reported case of BKV nephropathy after pediatric autologous SCT.

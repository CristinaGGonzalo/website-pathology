## Abstract
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of being the ideal prostate cancer (PCa) assessment tool. Information gathered with multiparametric MRI can serve therapy choice, guidance of interventions, and treatments. The purpose of this review is to discuss the potential role of multiparametric MRI in focal therapy with respect to patient selection and directing (robot-guided) biopsies and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Multiparametric MRI is a versatile and promising technique. It appears to be the best available imaging technique at the moment in localizing, staging (primary as well as recurrent disease, and local as well as distant disease), determining aggressiveness, and volume of PCa. However, larger study populations in multicenter settings have to confirm these promising results. However, before such studies can be performed more research is needed in order to achieve standardized imaging protocols.

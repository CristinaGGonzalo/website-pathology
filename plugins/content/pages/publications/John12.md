## Abstract
We present a case of severe refractory constipation in an adolescent oncology patient with widely metastatic clear cell osteosarcoma who was ultimately found to have Ogilvie syndrome, also known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO). Ogilvie syndrome is characterized by dilatation of the large intestine in the absence of mechanical obstruction, usually occurring in adult patients with serious underlying medical conditions and rarely seen in children. It is likely that chronic narcotic use, abdominal metastasis, and a paraneoplastic process contributed to development of ACPO in this patient. This case highlights an infrequent, but important, gastrointestinal complication that can occur in pediatric patients with serious comorbid disease. Ogilvie syndrome should be included on the differential diagnosis list in pediatric patients with refractory constipation. Our case illustrates the progression of therapies, including surgical intervention that can be undertaken to treat this disorder in children and adults while providing important considerations for clinicians treating patients of any age with this unusual clinical complication.

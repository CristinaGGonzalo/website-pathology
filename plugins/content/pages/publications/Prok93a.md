## Abstract
Observer performance with four unsharp mask filtering algorithms for storage phosphor chest radiographs was compared with that with conventional screen-film radiographs in the detection of three types of simulated lung disease: nodules, fine lines, and micronodule clusters. Previously studied parameter sets (small [1.4-mm] and medium [5-mm] filter masks) and two new parameter sets (large [2.5-cm] and ultralarge [7-cm] masks) were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic analysis. With medium and small masks, nodule detection was inferior to that achieved with other modes. Use of ultralarge masks decreased the detection of lines compared with detection with conventional screen-film radiographs. Although detection of micronodule clusters was worse with digital images than with conventional screen-film radiographs, results with large and ultralarge masks were better than with small masks. Overall, filtering with large masks was best suited for simultaneously matching linear, nodular, and micronodular structures. These results suggest that lesion-specific processing of digital chest images is not necessary.

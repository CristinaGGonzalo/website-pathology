title: Advanced MR Imaging Techniques in Localization and Local Staging of Prostate Carcinoma

## J.J. F"utterer

## Abstract
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, 1H-MR spectroscopic and dynamic contrast- enhanced MR imaging techniques allow us to investigate patients with prostate cancer. These techniques can be used for tumor localization and local staging. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate how these advanced MR techniques will improve localization and local staging performance in prostate carcinoma and if these results will further improve at high field strength (i.e. 3 Tesla). Clinical consequences of these new techniques were also discussed.

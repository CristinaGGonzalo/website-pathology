## Abstract
Gastroparesis is a challenging gastrointestinal complication of deceased-donor lung transplantation and heart-lung transplantation, but it has not been reported after living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT). To better understand this complication after LDLLT, we reviewed our institutional experiences. Among the 32 patients who survived for at least 3 months after LDLLT, five (16 %) developed symptomatic gastroparesis. All five patients had undergone bilateral LDLLT, and gastroparesis was diagnosed within 2 months after transplantation. Neither adult patients who received single lobar LDLLT nor pediatric patients who received either bilateral or single lobar LDLLT developed gastroparesis. Although gastroparesis-related symptoms improved after medical treatment in three patients, two patients died of complications related to gastroparesis. We conclude that gastroparesis can occur after LDLLT and may cause grave complications unless carefully managed.

## Abstract
Fluoroscopy guided interventions, such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures, can results in relatively high radiation doses to patients and staff. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of dedicated fluoroscopy exposure factors in the reduction of doses. Doses to patients and staff were measured during fluoroscopy-guided TIPS procedures in two Dutch university hospitals. Patient doses were calculated from dose-area product (DAP) measurements, entrance beam dimensions and DAP conversion factors. Staff doses were measured outside lead aprons using electronic personal dosemeters. Average patient entrance skin dose (ESD) rate during fluoroscopy was 49 mGy min-1 (13 cases, average fluoroscopy duration 32 min) in one hospital, and 6 mGy min-1 (10 cases, average fluoroscopy duration 50 min) in the other. Estimated staff effective dose per procedure was 28 microSv average in the first hospital compared with 4 microSv average in the other. The use of dedicated fluoroscopy exposure factors, with a relatively high tube voltage and lower tube current resulted in a significant dose reduction for patient and staff in this type of radiological intervention.

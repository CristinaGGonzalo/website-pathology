## Abstract
Mechanical ventilation (MV) can result in inflammation and subsequent lung injury. Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and NF-ÎºB are proposed to play a crucial role in the MV-induced inflammatory response. Resveratrol (RVT) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo supposedly by interfering with TLR4 signaling and NF-ÎºB. In the present study, we investigated the role of RVT in MV-induced inflammation in mice.RVT (10â€‰mg/kg, 20â€‰mg/kg and 40â€‰mg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered 1â€‰h before start of MV (4â€‰h, tidal volume 8â€‰ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure 1,5â€‰cmH2 O and FiO2 0.4). Blood and lungs were harvested for cytokine analysis. DNA binding activity of transcription factor NF-ÎºB was measured in lung homogenates.MV resulted in elevated pulmonary concentrations of IL-1Î², IL-6, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and NF-ÎºB DNA-binding activity. RVT at 10, 20 and 40â€‰mg/kg reduced NF-ÎºB's DNA-binding activity following MV compared with ventilated controls. However, no differences in cytokine release were found between RVT-treated and control ventilated mice. Similarly, in plasma, MV resulted in elevated concentrations of TNF-Î±, KC and IL-6, but RVT did not affect cytokine levels.RVT abrogates the MV-induced increase in pulmonary NF-ÎºB activity but does not attenuate cytokine levels. This implies a less prominent role for NF-ÎºB in MV-induced inflammation than previously assumed.

## Abstract
In this review, we summarized and critically discussed the most recent developments in the field of MRI-compatible robot-guided prostate interventions.Currently, systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for prostate cancer detection is the standard of care. Multiparametric MRI providing anatomic, functional and molecular information is the most promising imaging technique to detect and localize prostate cancer. A number of MRI-compatible robots, ranging from simple manipulators to a fully automated system, have been developed. The feasibility of these MRI-compatible robotic devices in closed-bore systems for prostatic interventions have been investigated. However, most studies focused on phantom experiments rather than on patients' studies. Thus far, only a small number of patients have undergone MRI- guided and robotic-assisted prostate biopsy. Although this potential technique shows promising results, there is little evidence for its clinical applicability.The combination of MRI-guided and robotic-assisted prostate biopsy is a promising technique for prostate cancer detection. However, only limited research is performed in patients, and therefore the current clinical value of this technique is highly speculative.

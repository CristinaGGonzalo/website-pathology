## Abstract
(19)Fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F MRS) offers unique possibilities for monitoring the pharmacokinetics of fluoropyrimidines in vivo in tumors and normal tissue in a non-invasive way, both in animals and in patients. This method may therefore be useful for predicting response to fluoropyrimidine-based therapy with or without the effects of modulating agents, and this may be of value for the individualization of anticancer therapy and the strategic development of new anticancer drugs. (19)F MRS has been very valuable in elucidating the basic aspects of fluoropyrimidine metabolism, especially in animal studies. Studies in humans have indicated its clinical potential, but widespread application has been hampered by the relatively low detection sensitivity of the method. The recent introduction of clinical MR scanners with magnetic fields above 1.5 T may stimulate increased clinical use of (19)F MRS.

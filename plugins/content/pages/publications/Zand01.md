## Abstract
This introductory article addresses approaches currently in use to process in vivo spectra. First, a brief overview is given of the information content represented by the parameters of MR signals. Subsequently, common steps in the processing of MR spectra such as pre-processing, normalisation and quantification and the use of prior knowledge are described. Finally, some prospects for more advanced processing are given.

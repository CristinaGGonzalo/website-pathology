## Abstract
The purpose of the present guidelines on the radioiodine therapy (RAIT) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) formulated by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Therapy Committee is to provide advice to nuclear medicine clinicians and other members of the DTC-treating community on how to ablate thyroid remnant or treat inoperable advanced DTC or both employing large 131-iodine ((131)I) activities.For this purpose, recommendations have been formulated based on recent literature and expert opinion regarding the rationale, indications and contraindications for these procedures, as well as the radioiodine activities and the administration and patient preparation techniques to be used. Recommendations also are provided on pre-RAIT history and examinations, patient counselling and precautions that should be associated with (131)I iodine ablation and treatment. Furthermore, potential side effects of radioiodine therapy and alternate or additional treatments to this modality are reviewed. Appendices furnish information on dosimetry and post-therapy scintigraphy.

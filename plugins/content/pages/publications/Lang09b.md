## Abstract
To compare iomeprol 400 and iodixanol 320 in pulmonary artery MDCTA in subjects with suspected pulmonary embolism.Eighty randomized subjects received equi-iodine intravenous doses (48 g) of iomeprol 400 (n=40) or iodixanol 320 (n=40), via power injector at 4 mL/s. Four-row (35 subjects) and 64-row (45 subjects) scanners were used. Lumen attenuation was determined on-site and by two off-site blinded readers in the main, lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Statistical comparison between groups was performed for demographics and lumen attenuation.There were no between-group differences (p>0.05) in demographics. Pulmonary artery attenuation was significantly (p<or=0.03) higher with iomeprol 400 for all readers. Attenuation quality was excellent in more patients after iomeprol 400 than after iodixanol-320 (80% vs. 62.5%; 82.5% vs. 77.5%; off-site readers 1 and 2, respectively). No safety concerns were noted.The greater iodine delivery rate achievable with iomeprol 400 compared to iodixanol-320 at equi-iodine dose and injection rate permits consistently greater attenuation at all levels of the pulmonary arterial tree.

## Abstract
In this study the influence of various tissue processing and staining techniques on the acoustical properties of liver tissue was investigated. A qualitative study was performed using ultrasound attenuation as the imaged parameter of a combined optical/acoustical microscope with a 1.2 GHz transducer. Images were made of three sets of adjacent liver sections (6 microns in thickness) which were prepared in ten different ways: fixed by alcohol or formalin; stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE), toluidine blue (TB) or non-stained; sectioned by a cryostat or by a paraffin microtome. It was concluded that the images obtained from cryostat sections were of much higher quality than those from paraffin sections. Images obtained from sections that were sectioned while embedded in paraffin displayed no detail at all. No consistent effect was noticed with respect to staining by HE or TB. Alcohol fixed sections gave more detailed images than formalin fixed sections. Formalin fixation in combination with cryostat sectioning yielded many cytoplasmic vacuoles.

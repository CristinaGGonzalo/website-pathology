## Abstract
Early detection of pulmonary nodules is crucial for improving prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Computer-aided detection of lung nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans has a great potential to enhance the performance of the radiologist in detecting nodules. In this paper we present a computer-aided lung nodule detection system for computed tomography (CT) scans that works in three steps. The system ï¿½?rst segments the lung using thresholding and hole ï¿½?lling. From this segmentation the system extracts candidate nodules using Laplacian of Gaussian. To reject false positives among the detected candidate nodules, multiple established features are calculated. We propose a novel feature based on a spherical shell ï¿½?lter, which is speciï¿½?cally designed to distinguish between vascular structures and nodular structures. The performance of the proposed CAD system was evaluated by partaking in the ANODE09 challenge, which presents a platform for comparing automatic nodule detection programs. The results from the challenge show that our CAD system ranks third among the submitted works, demonstrating the efï¿½?cacy of our proposed CAD system. The results also show that our proposed spherical shell ï¿½?lter in combination with conventional features can signiï¿½?cantly reduce the number of false positives from the detected candidate nodules.

## Abstract
Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumor in children. Especially, in association with the Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon it can be life threatening. The management of these patients is very difficult and an aggressive treatment regime is required. Several multimodality and chemotherapeutic regimens have been described but with variable success and many side effects. We present a 6-week-old boy with Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon. Ongoing propranolol treatment with only 4 initial courses of vincristine resulted in a remission that lasted at least 1 year.

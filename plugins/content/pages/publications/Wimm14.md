## Abstract
Bioassays that predict clinical outcome are essential to optimize cellular anticancer immunotherapy. We have recently developed a robust and simple skin test to evaluate the capacity of tumor-specific T cells to migrate, recognize their targets and exert effector functions. This bioassay detects T cells with an elevated antineoplastic potential and hence rapidly identifies patients responding to immunotherapy.

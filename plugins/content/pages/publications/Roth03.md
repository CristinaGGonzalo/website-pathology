## Abstract
Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) is an invasive, technically difficult, non-repeatable and demanding operation. In this study we report the development of a less invasive alternative for the surgical IHP in a pig model.Our technique was tested in 8 Yorkshire pigs (60 kg). The liver was isolated from the systemic circuit using minimally invasive techniques: an occlusion stent-graft and balloon catheters, with reversal of the blood flow through the liver during IHP.Tests with varying pressures applied at the PV revealed a clear relation between the suction pressure at the outflow site (PV), intrahepatic pressure and systemic leakage of 99mTc. A leakage-free IHP could be obtained in seven separate experiments.Isolated hepatic perfusion using minimally invasive techniques is feasible in pigs when the intrahepatic pressure is controlled. This technique has yet to be tested in patients.

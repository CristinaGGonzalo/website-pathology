title: Intravascular Ultrasound Elastography

## Abstract
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a technique that provides real-time cross sectional images in vivo of the geometry of the vessel wall, plaque and lumen. However, characterization of different plaque components st.ill remains a problem. Although other new imaging techniques show promising results, characterization of atherosclerotic plaques in vivo remains difficult. An even more challenging problem is identification of plaque vulnerability. Elastography is a Hew imaging technique that visualizes mechanical properties of tissue. The underlying principle is that the response of tissue to a mechanical excitation is a function of its mechanical properties. The technique was evaluated in vitro, and experiments in vivo demonstrated the potential to apply elastography in a clinical environment. In this thesis, the usefulness and additional diagnostic value of the technique for intravascular purposes is investigated.

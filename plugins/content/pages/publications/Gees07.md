## Abstract
Chondroblastoma of bone is a rare tumor that occurs most often in the epiphysis or apophysis of long bones. This benign tumor sometimes shows aggressive or malignant behaviour, and rarely metastases occur. Since wide resection often leads to growth impairment, intra-lesional curettage followed by an adjuvant therapy is developed to decrease the negative effects on growth and function without increased recurrence rates.Between 1980 and 2001, 18 patients were treated for chondroblastoma of bone. Since 1989 cryosurgery has been used as an adjuvant treatment. The functional and oncologic results at follow-up were studied.Four patients were treated with curettage, and four with wide resection without adjuvant therapy. One patient developed a local recurrence and distant metastases. Ten patients were treated with curettage and cryosurgery. One patient developed a local recurrence 6 years later that was treated with curettage and cryosurgery again. No serious complications from cryosurgery occurred and the functional results at follow-up were excellent [mean MSTS score at follow-up 29].Chondroblastoma of bone is a benign tumor with a relatively high recurrence rate. The local recurrence rates can be decreased with cryosurgery as a local adjuvant therapy with excellent functional results.

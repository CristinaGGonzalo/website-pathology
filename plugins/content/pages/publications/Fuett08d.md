## Abstract
Whole-body 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanners are presently becoming more widely available in the clinical setting. The increased signal-to-noise ratio inherent at 3 T as compared with 1.5 T offers potentials for clinical MR imaging such as shortening of imaging time and increased spatial, spectral, or temporal resolution or a combination of these. As a result, high-in-plane-resolution anatomic MR images can be obtained. This review will address the advantages and drawbacks of local staging with MR imaging at 3 T in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, the current diagnostic performance of prostate MR imaging in staging prostate cancer at high field strength is discussed.

## Abstract
The occurrence of an abrupt acceleration in phosphocreatine hydrolysis in the tibial anterior muscle during the last part of a sustained isometric exercise at 30% maximal voluntary contraction until fatigue is demonstrated in seven out of eight healthy subjects by applying in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy at 1.5 T field strength. This additional third phase in PCr hydrolysis, is preceded by a common biphasic pattern (first fast then slow) in PCr use. The NMR spectra, as localized by a surface coil and improved by proton irradiation, were collected at a time resolution of 16 s. Mean rates of PCr hydrolysis during exercise were -0.44 +/- 0.19% s(-1), -0.07 +/- 0.04% s(-1), and -0.29 +/- 0.10% s(-1) for the three successive phases. The increased rate of PCr hydrolysis, and also the loss of fine force control evident in the force records are consistent with increased involvement of large, fast-fatiguable units later in the contraction.

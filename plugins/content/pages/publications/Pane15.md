## Abstract
The purpose of this pictorial review is to present a wide spectrum of prostate multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) pitfalls that may occur in clinical practice, with radiological and pathological correlation.All examinations were performed according to ESUR Guidelines protocols.mp-MRI imaging of the prostate often leads to interpreting doubts and misdiagnosis due to the many interpretative pitfalls that a tissue, whether healthy or treated, may cause. These "false-positive" findings may occur in each stage of the disease history, from the primary diagnosis and staging, to the post-treatment stage, and whether they are caused by the tissue itself or are iatrogenic, their recognition is critical for proper treatment and management. Knowledge of these known pitfalls and their interpretation in the anatomical-radiological context can help radiologists avoid misdiagnosis and consequently mistreatment.â€¢ Some physiological changes in the peripheral and central zone may simulate prostate cancer. â€¢ Technical errors, such as mispositioned endorectal coils, can affect the mp-MRI interpretation. â€¢ Physiological changes post-treatment can simulate recurrence.

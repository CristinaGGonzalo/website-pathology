## Abstract
Next to aneurysm size, aneurysm growth over time is an important indicator for aneurysm rupture risk. In this paper a semi-automated method for quantifying aneurysm volume growth over time in CTA data is presented. The method treats a series of longitudinal images as a 4D dataset. Using a 4D non-rigid registration, deformations with respect to baseline scan are determined. Combined with 3D aneurysm segmentation in baseline scan, volume change is assessed by inspecting the deformation field at the aneurysm wall. The results of applying the method to 10 patient data are in line with the assessment in the radiology reports.

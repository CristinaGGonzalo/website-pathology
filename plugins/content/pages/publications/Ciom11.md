## Abstract
In this paper we present a methodology for the automatic detection of media-adventitia border (MAb) in Intravascular Ultrasound. A robust computation of the MAb is achieved through a holistic approach where the position of the MAb with respect to other tissues of the vessel is used. A learned quality measure assures that the resulting MAb is optimal with respect to all other tissues. The mean distance error computed through a set of 140 images is 0.2164 (Â±0.1326) mm.

## Abstract
We demonstrate the presence of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins in the wall and thrombosed lumen of an enlarged intracranial aneurysm after flow diverter treatment. These proteins have shown to play an important role in vascular inflammation and may serve as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for intracranial aneurysms.

## Abstract
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using Î²-emitting radiolabelled somatostatin analogues like DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate shows beneficial results in patients suffering from somatostatin receptor overexpressing tumours. However, after high-dose therapy partial renal reabsorption of radiopeptides may lead to nephrotoxicity. Co-infusion of lysine/arginine lowers renal retention of these radiopeptides without affecting tumour uptake. Recently co-administration of Gelofusine has been described to have a comparable kidney-protecting effect in rats. In the present study optimal dosing of Gelofusine co-administration was studied in tumour-bearing rats.Doses of 40, 80, 120 or 160 mg/kg Gelofusine were co-injected with 15 Âµg DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, labelled with 3 MBq 111In for biodistribution (24 h post-injection, n = 4 per group) and with 60 MBq 111In for microSPECT imaging experiments at 3, 24 and 48 h post-injection. An additional group of rats received 80 mg/kg Gelofusine plus 400 mg/kg lysine co-injection. Biodistribution studies were performed both in older (475 g) and younger (300 g) rats, the latter bearing CA20948 tumours.Co-injection of 40 mg/kg Gelofusine resulted in 40-50% reduction of renal uptake and retention of 111In-DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, whereas higher doses further increased the reduction to 50-60% in both groups of rats. Combining Gelofusine and lysine caused 70% reduction of renal uptake. The uptake of radiolabelled octreotate both in somatostatin receptor-expressing normal tissues and tumours was not affected by Gelofusine co-injection.In rats co-injection of 80 mg/kg Gelofusine resulted in maximum reduction of renal retention of 111In-DOTA,Tyr3-octreotate, which was further improved when combined with lysine. Tumour uptake of radiolabelled octreotate was not affected, resulting in an increased tumour to kidney ratio.

title: The Clinical Efficacy of Chest Computed Tomography in Trauma Patients

## M. Brink

## Abstract
Chapter 1 of this thesis introduces multidetector computed tomography (CT) as an accurate, rapid, and therefore increasingly used tool in the initial assessment of blunt trauma patients. However, this chapter also points out that the increasing employment of CT might result in needless ionizing radiation exposure, time consumption, and costs in the care for trauma patients. The aims of this thesis were first to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chest CT in the initial evaluation of a wide spectrum of trauma patients, and second, to investigate how the use of CT of the chest can be optimized at lower radiation exposure, costs, and time consumption.

title: Evaluation of radiotracers for betacell imaging

## Inge van der Kroon

## Abstract
In this thesis two potential radiotracers to quantify the beta cell mass both in the native pancreas and after islet transplantation are characterized. Furthermore, the potential of an exocrine pancreatic tracer to simplify quantification of beta cell specific radiotracers was investigated. Finally, the potential damage to the islets due to accumulation of one of the characterized radiotracers is investigated.

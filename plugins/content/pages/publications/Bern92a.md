## Abstract
A 38-year-old layer of parquet flooring was referred because of memory impairment, tiredness and diffuse headaches. His work involved using several neurotoxic organic solvents. Extensive laboratory, neuropsychological, clinical neurophysiological, neuroadiological, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy studies were performed. The neuropsychological and behavioural assessments showed an organic brain syndrome. MR imaging and CT scanning of the brain revealed enlarged ventricles and generalized atrophy. 31P and 1H MR spectroscopic measurements did not show any abnormalities. Owing to recent improvements regarding sensitivity and facilitated assignment, MR spectroscopy may provide in the near future significant additional information on brain metabolism in patients with brain dysfunction presumably induced by organic solvents.

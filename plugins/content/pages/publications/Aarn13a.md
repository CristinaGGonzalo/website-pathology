## Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines require the cells to relocate to lymph nodes (LNs). Unfortunately, however, DC migration rates are typically very poor. We investigated strategies to increase the migration efficacy of DC-based vaccines. Surprisingly, a reduction in DC number, but not the conditioning of the injection site, improved LN targeting.

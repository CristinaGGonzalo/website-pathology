## Abstract
Assessing a diverse biomarker panel (NT-proBNP, TNF-Î±, galectin-3, IL-6, Troponin I, ST2 and sFlt-1) to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity after treatment with anthracyclines.Of 55 breast cancer patients biomarkers were assessed and echocardiography was performed one year after treatment with anthracyclines.29.1% of patients showed abnormal biomarker levels: NT-proBNP in 18.2%, TNF-Î± and Galectin-3 in 7.3%. IL-6, troponin I, ST2 and sFlt-1 were normal in all patients. A correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NT-proBNP was observed (râ€‰=â€‰-0.564, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01).The evaluated biomarkers do not contribute to early detection. Future research should focus on NT-proBNP.

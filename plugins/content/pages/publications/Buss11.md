## Abstract
To evaluate the accuracy and technical success of positioning a radiofrequency ablation (RFA) electrode in osteoid osteomas by use of a new real-time needle guidance technology combining cone-beam computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy.Percutaneous RFA of osteoid osteomas was performed in five patients (median age 18?years), under general anesthesia, with the use of cone-beam CT and fluoroscopic guidance for electrode positioning. The outcome parameters were technical success, meaning correct needle placement in the nidus; accuracy defined as the deviation (in mm) from the center of the nidus; and clinical outcome at follow-up.In all five cases, positioning was possible within 3?mm of the determined target location (median nidus size 6.8?mm; range 5-10.2?mm). All procedures were technically successful. All patients were free of pain at clinical follow-up. No complications were observed.Real-time fluoroscopy needle guidance based on cone-beam CT is a useful tool to accurately position radiofrequency needles for minimally invasive treatment of osteoid osteomas.

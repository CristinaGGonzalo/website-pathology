## Abstract
Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinsons Disease improves the motor function, but cognitive and emotional side effects occur. These can be minimized by an accurate location of the STN motor part, analyzing the connections with other brain areas. In this study, we compare DTI and HARDI glyphs around the rat STN. The HARDI glyphs are more heterogeneous than the mostly oblate DTI glyphs. We observe crossings in the lateral STN, while a linear configuration can be seen medially. We may thus distinguish the lateral motor part and the medial cognitive/emotional part of the rat STN.

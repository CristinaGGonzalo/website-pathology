## Abstract
In this paper we compare and combine two distinct pattern classification approaches to the automated detection of regions with interstitial abnormalities in frontal chest radiographs. Standard two-class classifiers and recently developed one-class classifiers are considered. The one-class problem is to find the best model of the normal class and reject all objects that don't fit the model of normality. This one-class methodology was developed to deal with poorly balanced classes, and it uses only objects from a well-sampled class for training. This may be an advantageous approach in medical applications, where normal examples are easier to obtain thanabnormal cases. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate classification performance by the different methods as a function of the number of abnormal cases available for training. Various two-class classifiers performed excellently in case that enough abnormal examples were available (area under ROC curve Az = 0.985 for a linear discriminant classifier). The one-class approach gave worse result when used stand-alone (Az = 0.88 for Gaussian data description) but the combination of both approaches, using a mean combining classifier resulted in better performance when only few abnormal samples were available (average Az = 0.94 for the combination and Az = 0.91 for the stand-alone linear discriminant in the same set-up). This indicates that computer-aided diagnosis schemes may benefit from using a combination of two-class and one-class approaches when only few abnormal samples are available.

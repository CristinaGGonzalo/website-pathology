## Abstract
The aim of this study was to assess the differentiation of histologically different types of choroidal melanomas by means of clinical and quantitative acoustic/texture parameters of echograms. Clinical parameters were graded by morphological, kinetic and quantitative statements about the A- and B-mode echograms by a skilled diagnostician. Acoustic/texture parameters were obtained by processing and analysing radio frequency, AM-demodulated and FM-demodulated echograms. The latter data were preprocessed to remove influence induced by beam diffraction and focusing. The best set of four clinical echographic parameters enabled a retrospective classification of spindle type melanomas vs. mixed+epithelioid type melanomas with an accuracy of 77% (area under the ROC-curve of 86%). The discriminant analysis performed with the best four acoustic/texture parameters (n = 30) yielded a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 92%, and an area under the ROC-curve which corresponds to a probability of correct classification of 96.6%. When using these data prospectively to classify tumours of unknown cell type (n = 21), this classification could be performed in 86% of cases.

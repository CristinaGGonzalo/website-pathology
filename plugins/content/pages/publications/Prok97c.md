## Abstract
Recent developments in the non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computerised tomographic angiography (CTA) are challenging conventional catheter angiography. Current indications for both techniques are discussed, such as their ability to diagnose aortic, pulmonary, renal, carotid and peripheral vascular diseases. Both tools provide almost identical clinical results, although each has their own advantages and disadvantages. MRA should be the technique of choice in young patients or those with real impairment since the gadolinium-based contrast agents are non-ionising and do not cause nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, MRA examination times are longer than those typically required for CTA, and therefore MRA is less suited to examinations of acute conditions.

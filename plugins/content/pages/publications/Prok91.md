## Abstract
A programme for controlled automated histomorphometric evaluation of bone biopsies, connected with authors' results with semiautomated program, introduces new technology as well as new principle. It is based on a digitalization of microscopic picture in videocamera followed by controlled automated computerized processing of the picture. A further simplification of the evaluation process is achieved by eliminating a time consuming and not quite precise over-drawing of the picture on a digitalization desk.

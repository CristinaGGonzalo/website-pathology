## Abstract
The history of 50 years of applications of ultrasound in ophthalmology is described. This period started in 1938 with a study of the possible effects of high intensity ultrasound on eyes. The measurement of biological effects for the assessment of potential hazards characterizes the first decades. More recently, the therapeutic use of ultrasound by hyperthermia has gained much interest in ophthalmology. Further topics are: the measurement of acoustic characteristics of ocular tissues; the biometry of the eye ball, the results of which are used to calculate the optical power of artificial lens implants; the development of diagnostic instruments in various parts of the world; and ultrasonic tissue characterization for the differential diagnosis of pathology. The final topic is concerned with some recent developments which present a look into the future.

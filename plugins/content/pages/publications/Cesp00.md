## Abstract
Many intravascular therapeutic techniques for the treatment of significant atherosclerotic lesions are mechanical in nature: examples are angioplasty, stenting and atherectomy. The selection of the most adequate treatment would be advantageously aided by knowledge of the mechanical properties of the lesion and surrounding tissues. Based on the success of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in accurately depicting the morphology of atheromatous lesions, ultrasonic tissue characterisation has been proposed as a tool to determine the composition of atheroma. We describe the addition of local compliance information to the IVUS image in the form of a colour-coded line congruent with the lumen perimeter. The technique involves analysis of echo signals obtained at two or more states of incremental intravascular pressure. Using vessel phantoms and specimens, we demonstrate the utility of intravascular compliance imaging. The palpograms are able to identify lesions of different elasticity independently of the echogenicity contrast, because the information provided by the elastograms is generally independent of that obtained from the IVUS image. Thus, the palpogram can complement the characterisation of lesion from the IVUS image. We also describe cross-sectional measures of elasticity that are based on the elastogram. Finally, natural extensions of intravascular palpation to other endoluminal ultrasound applications are proposed.

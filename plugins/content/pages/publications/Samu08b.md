## Abstract
PURPOSE/AIM To experience the use of an interactive computer-aided decision support system for the detection of mammographic masses. To demonstrate the real-time classification of breast lesions. CONTENT ORGANIZATION The idea of using CAD in an interactive way will be explained. Then a case review will be offered, in which participants evaluate a small set of abnormal and normal screening mammograms in two sequential sessions: one without and the other with interactive CAD. Participants are asked to find and rate abnormal masses. At the end of the session, participants can judge their performance and are given the opportunity to review their scores for each case. SUMMARY Current computer-aided detection workstations display suspicious mammographic regions identified by computer algorithms as prompts to avoid perceptual oversights. In the presented system the presence of CAD regions can be probed interactively using a mouse click and aid the radiologist with the interpretation of masses. Initial studies suggest that readers may improve their detection performance using CAD in an interactive way.

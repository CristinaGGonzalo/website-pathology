## Abstract
The clinical application of 3D proton spectroscopic imaging (3D SI) of the human prostate requires a robust suppression of periprostatic lipid signal contamination, minimal intervoxel signal contamination, and the shortest possible measurement time. In this work, a weighted elliptical sampling of k-space, combined with k-space filtering and pulse repetition time (TR) reduction minimized lipid signals, intervoxel contamination, and measurement time. At 1.5 T, the MR-visible prostate metabolites citrate, creatine, and choline can now be mapped over the entire human prostate with uncontaminated spherical voxels, with a volume down to 0.37 cm3, in measurement times of 7-15 min.

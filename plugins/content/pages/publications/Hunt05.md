## Abstract
Intraoperative MR imaging (IMRI) has advantages over conventional framed and frameless techniques. IMRI, however, also has some drawbacks, especially related to interpretation of gadolinium-enhanced intraoperative imaging resulting from surgically induced blood brain barrier injury, vascular changes, and hemorrhage. Ultra-small superparamagnetic iron particles like ferumoxtran-10 have a long plasma half-life and are trapped by reactive cells within the tumor. These trapped particles provide a method to demonstrate enhancing lesions without the artifact of repeat gadolinium administration in the face of blood brain barrier and vascular injury. We present a review of the literature and the cases of two patients who underwent surgery in which IMRI with ferumoxtran-10 was used. Ultra-small superparamagnetic iron particles represent a method to demonstrate enhancing intrinsic brain tumors without the drawbacks of intraoperative gadolinium enhancement. These lesions appear even on low-field strength IMRI. Ferumoxtran-10, administered preoperatively, provides a stable imaging marker, even after surgical manipulation of the brain. Fermumoxtran-10 provides a way to lessen artifactual enhancement during IMRI related to the administration of gadolinium.

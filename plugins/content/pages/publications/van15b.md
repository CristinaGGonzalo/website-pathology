## Abstract
Parental high-fat feeding was proposed to negatively impact metabolic health in offspring. Here, the ectopic fat storage in heart and liver in offspring was investigated, and the effects on mitochondrial function, de novo lipogenesis, and postprandial lipid metabolism were explored in detail.Male and female mice received either a high-fat (HF) or standard chow (LF) diet during mating, gestation and lactation. All offspring animals received the HF diet.Abdominal visceral adipose tissue tended to be higher in HF/HF mice. Cardiac lipid content was also higher in the HF/HF mice (LF/HF vs.1.03%â€‰Â±â€‰0.08% vs. 1.33%â€‰Â±â€‰0.07% of water signal, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). In contrast, hepatic lipid content tended to be lower in HF/HF mice compared to LF/HF mice. A severely disturbed postprandial lipid clearance was revealed in HF/HF mice by the results from the triglyceride (TG) tolerance tests (LF/HF vs.6,753â€‰Â±â€‰2,213 vs. 14,367â€‰Â±â€‰1,978 mmolÂ l(-1) Â min(-1) , Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and (13) C-fatty acid retention test (LF/HF vs.2.73%â€‰Â±â€‰0.85% vs. 0.89%â€‰Â±â€‰0.26% retention from bolus, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), which may underlie the lower hepatic lipid content.Here it is shown that HF diet negatively impacts postprandial TG clearance in offspring and results in an overall metabolic unfavorable phenotype and ectopic lipid deposition in the heart and in visceral storage sites.

## Abstract
To evaluate the role of 2D myocardial strain (rate) imaging in the detection of early subclinical cardiotoxicity in breast cancer survivors treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimen. 57 adult breast cancer survivors were analyzed 1 year after therapy. All patients underwent biomarker analysis and 2D echocardiography consisting of conventional echocardiographic and strain (rate) parameters. Conventional echocardiographic values were normal. Global longitudinal strain was normal, but 18 % of patients showed a >2 SD decrease when individually compared to reference values. This subgroup showed a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and an increase in left ventricular mass. Radial and circumferential strain rates were significantly decreased in the whole study group. 2D myocardial strain (rate) imaging showed abnormalities in breast cancer survivors, while conventional echocardiographic values remained normal, rendering 2D myocardial strain (rate) imaging an interesting tool for the early detection of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

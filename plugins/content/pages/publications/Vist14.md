## Abstract
In this paper we report one case of skin burns in MRI caused by induced electrical currents. Two second degree skin burns occurred during imaging, while operating within all current safety guidelines. The currents are induced by the magnetic-gradient field, as well as the radiofrequency pulses. A closed conducting loop can occur while there is skin-to-skin contact, or for example when the patient is wearing ECG leads, monitoring sensors or cables. When a loop originates within the patient for a longer time, the current can resonate and dissipate high local energy through a rise in temperature. While rare, clinicians need to be aware of this possible event. By avoiding focal skin-to-skin contact of the extremities in this case, the adverse event could have been avoided.

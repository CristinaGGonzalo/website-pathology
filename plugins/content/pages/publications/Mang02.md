## Abstract
Virtual colonoscopy or computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a rapidly evolving technique for imaging the entire colon and detection of colorectal polyps. It uses standard helical computed tomography images of the colon and advanced imaging software to produce reformatted two- and three-dimensional views of the entire colorectum. Multi-detector row helical computed tomography has several technical advantages over single-detector row computed tomographic, including faster imaging times with the acquisition of thinner sections. The improved speed and spatial resolution of multislice computed tomography promises an increase of sensitivity and specificity, especially for the detection of colorectal lesions.

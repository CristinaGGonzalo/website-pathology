## Abstract
Targeting of the Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor with (111)In-labeled exendin is an attractive approach to determine the beta cell mass (BCM). Preclinical studies as well as a proof-of-concept study in type 1 diabetic patients and healthy subjects showed a direct correlation between BCM and radiotracer uptake. Despite these promising initial results, the influence of alpha cells on the uptake of the radiotracer remains a matter of debate. In this study we determined the correlation between pancreatic tracer uptake and beta and alpha cell mass in a rat model for beta cell loss. The uptake of (111)In-exendin (%ID/g) showed a strong positive linear correlation with the BCM (Pearson r = 0.82). The fraction of glucagon positive cells in the total endocrine mass was increased after alloxan treatment (26% Â± 4%, 43% Â± 8%, and 69% Â±21% for 0, 45 and 60 mg/kg alloxan, respectively). The uptake of (111)In-exendin showed a negative linear correlation with the alpha cell fraction (Pearson r = -0.76). These data clearly indicate towards specificity of (111)In-exendin for beta cells and that the influence of the alpha cells on (111)In-exendin uptake is negligible.

## Abstract
Repair of aortic coarctation was performed in 152 adolescent and adult patients (mean age 28.5 years, range 14-67 years). Ninety patients were treated with patch plasty, 33 with end-to-end anastomosis, 18 with interposition of a tubular graft, 6 with prosthetic bypass and 5 with direct plasty. There were two (1.3%) early and ten (6.6%) late deaths after 2.9 to 11.8 (mean 6.6) years. Of the remaining 140 patients, 129 (92.1%) were reexamined with computed tomography and angiography after 1.5 to 17.2 (mean 9.1) years postoperatively. In 27 patients (35.1%) of the patch plasty group significant dilatation at the operative site was observed and reoperation for aneurysm formation was required in 15 patients (19.5%). Resection of the intimal crest did not increase the probability of aneurysm formation, whereas Dacron as patch material and late hypertension had a significant influence. Six of the ten late deaths occurred in the patch plasty group. Rupture of an aneurysm at the operative site was proved in two of these patients, and three patients died suddenly for unknown reasons. In the other groups significant dilatation was observed in 13 patients and 3 local aneurysms required reoperation (2 after end-to-end anastomosis and 1 after direct plasty). We conclude that patch plasty repair of coarctation should be abandoned in adults. End-to-end anastomosis is advisable only if possible without excessive tension. Reoperation with interposition of a tubular graft on left heart bypass proved to be a safe method.

## Abstract
Micro- and nanotextured biomaterial surfaces have been widely studied for their capacity to drive the regeneration of organized tissues. Nanotopographical features in the shape of groove-ridge patterns aim at mimicking the extracellular matrix organization. However, to date, a wide array of groove and ridge sizes has been described. In this work, we therefore tested a device composed of a multipatterned array consisting of six patterns of radially arranged parallel nanogrooves, with a pitch ranging from 0 to 1000ï¿½??nm and a depth ranging from 0 to 170ï¿½??nm, to be used as a tool for the expeditious and simultaneous screening of surface topographies aiming the regeneration of anisotropically organized tissues such as ligament. The topographies were reproduced in (1) epoxy resin or (2) membranes produced by the crosslinking of platelet lysate (PL) with genipin (gPL). Both materials were seeded with periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) and the proliferation, migration, as well as cell alignment were assessed. The effect of topography in PDLCs was only evident in terms of cell organization, resulting in a highly anisotropic organization of the cells for the 1000 and 600ï¿½??nm patterns, and in an increased isotropic organization for shallower topographies. Overall, our results suggest that this multipatterned system can be a valuable diagnostic tool for biomaterials aiming at the regeneration of anisotropically organized tissues, such as periodontal ligament.

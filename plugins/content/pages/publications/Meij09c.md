## Abstract
Summary: This article discusses some considerations concerning covered stent placement in a patient with a traumatic direct carotid-cavernous fistula. Our case supports recent reports in the literature that covered stent placement can be an acceptable alternative when detachable balloon occlusion or coil occlusion of a direct carotid-cavernous fistula fails or cannot be done. Positioning of a covered stent in the internal carotid artery can be technically challenging. No specific covered stents for neurovascular use have been designed or registered. Because of limited experience with covered stent placement in the carotid artery the optimal preventive and therapeutic strategies for thromboembolic complications are not known.

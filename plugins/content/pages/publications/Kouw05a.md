## Abstract
2-(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a noninvasive imaging technique used clinically to detect malignant tumors. FDG-PET has been established as a tool for diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Several case series suggest that FDG-PET also detects larger adenomas. The goal of this study was to investigate whether FDG-PET is able to detect colonic adenomas.FDG-PET was performed in 100 consecutive patients in whom colonic adenomas were suspected on barium enema (n = 47) or sigmoidoscopy (n = 53). A positive scan was defined as focal large bowel FDG accumulation. FDG-PET was followed in all cases by colonoscopy, and removed adenomas were examined histopathologically.Colonoscopy confirmed the presence of adenomas in 68 of 100 patients. In 35 patients, there was focal FDG accumulation at site of the adenoma. The sensitivity of FDG-PET increased with adenoma size (21%, adenomas 1 to 5 mm; 47%, 6 to 10 mm; and 72%, > 11 mm). The sensitivity of FDG-PET also increased with the grade of dysplasia (33%, low grade; 76%, high grade; and 89%, carcinomas). The overall specificity was 84%.FDG-PET detects colonic adenomas and the diagnostic test characteristics improve with size and grade of dysplasia of the adenoma.

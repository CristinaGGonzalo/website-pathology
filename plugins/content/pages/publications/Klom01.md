## Abstract
For optimal performance of 31P MRS at 1.5 Tesla, the use of a double resonant probe is essential to enable the application of 1H decoupling and Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement. This note describes the design, evaluation and safety validation of a versatile and compact probe optimized for 1H decoupled 31P MRS studies of tumors close to the surface of the body, in particular the head and neck region.

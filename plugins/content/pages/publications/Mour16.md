## Abstract
The incidence of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT - Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) in the Netherlands is 1:5000 but approximately 1:1300 in people from the Antilles. The disease is characterised by the development of telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that may result in serious morbidity and mortality.A 31-year-old primigravid patient consulted her general practitioner at 31 1/7 weeks gestational age with dyspnoea. She was referred for further diagnostics because of suspected pulmonary embolism. A CT scan showed haemothorax and a bleeding arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left lung. Family history suggested the possibility of HHT. After multidisciplinary consideration, a primary caesarean section was performed, followed by embolisation of the AVM during the same surgical session. The patient had a gene mutation consistent with HHT type 2.Pregnant patients with HHT are at risk of serious morbidity, especially if they are not screened for AVMs. A multidisciplinary approach for such patients, with consideration of various scenarios, is highly recommended.

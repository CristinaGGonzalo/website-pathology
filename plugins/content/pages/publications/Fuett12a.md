## Abstract
Approximately 30% of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy will develop biochemical recurrent disease. Biochemical recurrent disease is defined as an increase in the serum value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after reaching the nadir. Prostate recurrence can present as PSA-only relapse, local recurrent disease, distant metastases, or a combination of local and distant recurrence. In this review, the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the work-up of recurrent prostate cancer is discussed.

## Abstract
This study was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcome of measles in pediatric liver transplant recipients. This study includes a retrospective data analysis of five pediatric liver transplant recipients with measles who were treated at the Liver Transplant Section, Beijing Friendship Hospital, China, from March to April 2014. The clinical manifestations of measles in pediatric liver transplant recipients were serious. There were three cases complicated with pneumonia, and one with laryngitis. Two cases presented with severe measles pneumonia that developed into severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Four patients recovered after treatment and one patient died of respiratory failure. Pediatric liver transplant recipients with measles are at high risk of severe pneumonia. Measles pneumonitis is frequently fatal to immunocompromised pediatric patients. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.

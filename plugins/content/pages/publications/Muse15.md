title: Targeting renal cell carcinoma with radiolabeled antibodies

## Stijn Muselaers

## Abstract
The aim of this thesis was to further optimize the detction and treatment of ccRCC using radiolabeled mAb cG250/girentuximab. The preclinical and clinical studies presented in this thesis focus on detection of ccRCC with Indium-111 ( 111 In) labeled girentuximab and treatment of advanced disease with Lutetium-177 ( 177 Lu)-girentuximab. In addition, the feasibility of novel fluorescence imaging techniques for ccRCC which may ultimately lead to intraoperative detection of ccRCC lesions was evaluated.

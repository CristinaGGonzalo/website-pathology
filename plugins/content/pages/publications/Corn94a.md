## Abstract
In this study, it was investigated whether prostate tumor biological parameters correlate with metabolic profiles. 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from perchloric acid extracts of seven Dunning R-3327 prostate tumor sublines. Several metabolic ratios, for example, phosphocholine/total phosphate, choline/total creatine, and inositol/total creatine, did not correlate specifically with one biological characteristics but, based on each of these ratios, the well-differentiated, nonmetastatic, and hormone-dependent sublines could be discriminated from the poorly differentiated or anaplastic, metastatic, and hormone-independent sublines. The glycerophosphoethanolamine/total phosphate, glycerophosphocholine/total phosphate, and phosphocreatine/total phosphate ratios correlated with differentiation grade, and the differences in glycerophosphorylglycerol/total phosphate ratio between metastatic and nonmetastatic sublines was highly significant. No correlation for hormonal sensitivity with any of the metabolites measured could be found, neither by 31P nor by 1H MRS.

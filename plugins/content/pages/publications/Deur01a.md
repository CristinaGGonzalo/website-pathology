## Abstract
The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of breast tissue and the inaccuracy of needle positioning for biopsy (14-gauge) and localization (19.5-gauge) needles.For displacement of breast tissue, differences between the coordinates of identifiable microcalcifications in the images before (baseline) and after needle positioning were analyzed (n = 52). For accuracy of needle positioning, differences between the coordinates of the needle tip and the target were analyzed in breast tissue (n = 97) and in air (n = 246).Average target displacement was 2.1 mm for biopsy needles (95% prediction interval [PI] 0.6-7.8) and 1.0 mm (95% PI 0.3-3.9) for localization needles. Mean inaccuracy of needle positioning in breast tissue was 1.1 mm (95% PI 0.4-3.0) and 1.8 mm (95% PI 0.7-4.6) for biopsy and localization needles, respectively.Tissue and needle displacements cause a total positioning error of 2.4 mm in stereotactic core biopsy, which will limit the attainable diagnostic accuracy.

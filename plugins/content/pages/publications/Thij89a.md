## Abstract
A survey of present opinions on the safety of diagnostic ultrasound applications is presented together with some data on output levels. Physical mechanisms involved in potential adverse effects are described. Labelling requirements of the equipment are defined and specified. These requirements are contained in a recent proposal of the Netherlands' Committee on the Safety of Ultrasound.

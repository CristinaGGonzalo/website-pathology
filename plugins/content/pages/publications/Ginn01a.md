title: Computer-aided diagnosis in chest radiography

## B. van Ginneken

## Abstract
Chest radiographs account for more than half of all radiological examinations; the chest is the mirror of health and disease. This thesis is about techniques for computer analysis of chest radiographs. It describes methods for texture analysis and segmenting the lung fields and rib cage in a chest film. It includes a description of an automatic system for detecting regions with abnormal texture, that is applied to a database of images from a tuberculosis screening program.

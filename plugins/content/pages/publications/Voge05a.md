## Abstract
Many imaging modalities and scanning techniques, such as contrast enhanced CT, MRI and FDG-PET, are available for assessment of recurrent colorectal carcinoma. In addition, integrated PET/CT is becoming increasingly available. Intuitively, a synergistic combination of scanning characteristics sounds promising. However, the exact clinical value has not yet been fully established. The role of PET/CT image fusion must be weighed carefully against other available modalities. In this review we evaluate the potential of combined PET/CT in recurrent colorectal carcinoma. When available, PET/CT currently appears the diagnostic tool of choice. In the near future, combined PET/MRI may further enhance the diagnostic algorithm.

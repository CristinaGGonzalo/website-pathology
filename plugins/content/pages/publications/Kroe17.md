## Abstract
To assess whether laser guidance can reduce fluoroscopy and procedure time of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablations of osteoid osteoma compared to freehand CBCT guidance. 32 RF ablations were retrospectively analyzed, 17 laser-guided and 15 procedures using the freehand technique. Subgroup selection of 18 ablations in the hip-pelvic region with a similar degree of difficulty was used for a direct comparison. Data are presented as median (ranges). Comparison of all 32 ablations resulted in fluoroscopy times of 365 s (193-878 s) for freehand and 186 s (75-587 s) for laser-guided procedures (p = 0.004). Corresponding procedure times were 56 min (35-97 min) and 52 min (30-85 min) (p = 0.355). The subgroup showed comparable target sizes, needle path lengths, and number of scans between groups. Fluoroscopy times were lower for laser-guided procedures, 215 s (75-413 s), compared to 384 s (193-878 s) for freehand (p = 0.012). Procedure times were comparable between groups, 51 min (30-72 min) for laser guidance and 58 min (35-79 min) for freehand (p = 0.172). Adding laser guidance to CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma RF ablations significantly reduced fluoroscopy time without increasing procedure time. Level 4, case series.

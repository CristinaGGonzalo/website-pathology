## Abstract
In 3 patients, men aged 60, 55 and 60, respectively, with hypertension due to primary hyperaldosteronism, the aldosterone level in the adrenal veins was determined for the purpose of further diagnosis. In two patients, unilateral adrenal enlargement on the CT-scan was accompanied by overproduction ofaldosterone, in one case in a non-enlarged adrenal gland and in the other case in both adrenals. The first patient underwent adrenalectomy of the non-enlarged adrenal gland, while in the second patient surgery was decided against. The third patient had bilateral adrenal gland enlargement on the CT-scan with a surgically treatable, unilateral overproduction ofaldosterone. Now that determination ofthe aldosterone:renin ratio in plasma as a screening method in selected patients with hypertension is being used more often, primary hyperaldosteronism turns out to be more common than was previously thought. For differentiation between unilateral and bilateral overproduction of aldosterone, imaging of the adrenals, for example with CT, is insufficiently accurate. Aldosterone determination in the adrenal veins can distinguish between unilateral and bilateral overproduction of aldosterone with great accuracy, which has important therapeutic consequences.

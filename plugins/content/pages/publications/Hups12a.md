title: Detection of malignant masses in breast cancer screening by computer assisted decision making

## Hupse, R.

## Abstract
To detect breast cancers in an early stage, in most western countries screening programs are organized. A small fraction of the mammograms acquired in screening contain malignancies, which can be very subtle. In order to reduce oversight errors, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed. The effect of CAD techniques that are currently used in screening programs is not conclusive. The research described in this thesis had two goals. The first goal was to improve the performance of current CAD techniques for mass detection. The second goal was to investigate the use of CAD as decision support instead of perception aid.

title: MRI-guided focal therapy in patients with localized (recurrent) prostate cancer

## Joyce Bomers

## Abstract
Focal therapy as treatment option for localized (recurrent) prostate cancer is an increasingly accepted and fast developing area. Multi-parametric MR imaging is able to accurately detect and localize prostate cancer. MRI-guidance enables targeting of the tumor, treatment monitoring and to map the tissue temperature in real-time. The purpose of this thesis was to develop and optimize MRI-guided focal therapy in patients with localized (recurrent) prostate cancer.

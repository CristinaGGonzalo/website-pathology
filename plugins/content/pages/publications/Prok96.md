## Abstract
Spiral CT allows for examination of the whole chest within a single breathhold. As compared to standard CT, spiral CT has an increased sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary nodules, of small mediastinal and bronchopulmonary lymph nodes, and of pleural plaques improves characterization of lesion morphology. New diagnostic applications include the detection of very subtle diffuse lung disease and the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and vascular malformations. For the diagnosis of tracheobronchial pathology, spiral CT is an ideal supplement to bronchoscopy.

## Abstract
Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) with bispecific antibodies (bsMAb) and a radiolabeled peptide reduces the radiation dose to normal tissues. Here we report the accuracy of an (111)In-labeled pretherapy test dose for personalized dosing of (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 following pretargeting with the anti-CEA Ã— anti-hapten bsMAb, TF2, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).In 20 patients bone marrow absorbed doses (BMD) and doses to the kidneys were predicted based on blood samples and scintigrams acquired after (111)In-IMP288 injection for individualized dosing of PRIT with (177)Lu-IMP288. Different dose schedules were studied, varying the interval between the bsMAb and peptide administration (5 days vs. 1 day), increasing the bsMAb dose (75 mg vs. 150 mg), and lowering the peptide dose (100 Î¼g vs. 25 Î¼g).TF2 and (111)In/(177)Lu-IMP288 clearance was highly variable. A strong correlation was observed between peptide residence times and individual TF2 blood concentrations at the time of peptide injection (Spearman's ï¿½?â€‰=â€‰0.94, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). PRIT with 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-IMP288 resulted in low radiation doses to normal tissues (BMD <0.5 Gy, kidney dose <3 Gy). Predicted (177)Lu-IMP288 BMD were in good agreement with the actual measured doses (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD difference -0.0026â€‰Â±â€‰0.028 mGy/MBq). Hematological toxicity was mild in most patients, with only two (10 %) having grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia. A correlation was found between platelet toxicity and BMD (Spearman's ï¿½?â€‰=â€‰0.58, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008). No nonhematological toxicity was observed.These results show that individual high activity doses in PRIT in patients with CEA-expressing CRC could be safely administered by predicting the radiation dose to red marrow and kidneys, based on dosimetric analysis of a test dose of TF2 and (111)In-IMP288.

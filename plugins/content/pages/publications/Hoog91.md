## Abstract
Activation of natural killer (NK) cell activity is one of the immune functions which can be altered by the interferons (IFNs). We previously incubated healthy donor peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) in the presence of natural (n) IFN-alpha and found induction of granular lymphocytes, a proportion of which expressed CD 8 and CD 57. In the present study we further delineated the membrane characteristics of these induced granular lymphocytes and observed the greatest proportion to be CD 16+, with lesser proportions positive for CD 8, CD 57, or coexpressing CD 16 and CD 8. Thus, nIFN-alpha-induced granular lymphocytes have both the morphological and membrane characteristics of functional NK cells. However, in contrast to nIFN-alpha, incubations with recombinant (r) IFN-alpha and n- and rIFN-gamma were found to only enhance NK activity; the concomitant increase in granular lymphocytes as observed after nIFN-alpha incubation was absent. Therefore, even though the different IFNs applied had comparable effects on the function of cytotoxic effector cells, taking into account the observed morphological discrepancy, the unknown mechanisms or pathways by which this is achieved are apparently not identical.

## Abstract
A multi-institutional group has been created to demonstrate the utility of in vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) to study human cancers in vivo. This review is concerned with the novel problems concerning quality control in this large multinational trial of 31P MRS. Our results show that the careful and systematic performance of the quality control tests depicted here (standardized dual 1H/31P tuned radiofrequency probe, quality control procedures, routine use of 1H irradiation while acquiring 31P MR signals) has ensured comparable results between the different institutions. In studies made in vitro, the root-mean-square error was 3.6 %, and in muscle of healthy volunteers in vivo the coefficients of variance for the ratios phosphocreatine/nucleotide-triphosphates, phosphocreatine/noise and nucleotide-triphosphate/noise were 12.2, 7.0 and 10.8 %, respectively. The standardization of the acquisition protocol for in vivo-localized 31P MR spectroscopy across the different institutions has resulted in comparable in vivo data, decreasing the possible problems related to a research study carried out under a multi-institutional setting.

## Abstract
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against tumor-associated antigens has evolved from an appealing concept to one of the standard treatment options for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Inefficient localization of radiolabeled MAbs to nonhematological cancers due to various tumor-related factors, however, has refrained RIT from outgrowing the experimental stage in solid tumors. Still, small volume or minimal residual disease has been recognized as a potentially suitable target for radiolabeled antibodies. Several strategies are being explored aimed at improving the targeting of radiolabeled MAbs to solid tumors thus improving their therapeutic efficacy. In this review, a historical overview of the application of RIT is given and various aspects of the application of radiolabeled MAbs as anti-cancer agents are discussed. Finally, the clinical results of RIT of NHL, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and renal cell cancer are reviewed.

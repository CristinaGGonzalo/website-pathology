## Abstract
Fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans, and they are a growing problem due to the increased usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapies. The equilibrium between the commensal microbial flora and the immune system that protects the host against invasive fungal infection is disturbed during disease, and understanding this disturbed balance is important to develop new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of fungal infection. In the context of tolerating fungi during colonization and eliciting a vigorous immune response to eliminate invading fungal pathogens when needed, the inflammasome has been identified as an integral component of antifungal host defense. It contributes to mucosal host defense by regulating T-helper 17 (Th17) cell responses, and contributes to protective responses such as neutrophil influx during fungal sepsis. Several aspects are important for understanding the role of the inflammasome for antifungal host defense, such as the role of fungal cell wall morphology and its components in triggering the inflammasome, the pattern recognition pathways and downstream signaling cascades involved in the activation of the inflammasome, and the effects of inflammasome activation during fungal infection. The future perspectives of inflammasome research in fungal immunology, with emphasis on targeting the inflammasome for the design of future immunotherapies, is also discussed.

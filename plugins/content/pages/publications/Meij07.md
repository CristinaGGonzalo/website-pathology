## Abstract
Multislice Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive modality for the detection of coronary artery stenosis. Image quality is still limited when compared to conventional coronary angiography. However, CTCA has been demonstrated to be highly reliable to rule out coronary artery stenosis. Technological improvements and the combination of CTCA with other non-invasive modalities are expected to further increase diagnostic accuracy. Although CTCA has clearly left the research environment, the precise role of CTCA in the diagnostic work-up of coronary artery disease needs further research.

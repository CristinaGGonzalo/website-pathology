## Abstract
Intravascular elastography is a new technique to obtain the local mechanical properties of the vessel wall and its pathology using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Knowledge of these mechanical properties may be useful for guiding interventional procedures. An experimental set-up is described for assessment of the strain data of arteries. Using a 30-MHz IVUS catheter, radio frequency data are acquired with a custom-made high-performance data acquisition system. High-resolution, local tissue displacement estimation by cross-correlation is followed by computation of local strain. An algorithm that uses a priori knowledge of the correlation coefficient function was applied to filter the obtained strain data. With this experimental set-up, intravascular elastograms containing 400 angles/revolution with a radial resolution of 200 microns can be produced. The feasibility of intravascular elastography with this experimental set-up is demonstrated using two diseased human femoral arteries. Qualitative comparison of the elastograms with the echograms and the histology demonstrates the potential of intravascular elastography to obtain mechanical information from the vessel wall and from plaque.

## Abstract
PURPOSE: To assess metabolite levels in peritumoral edematous (PO) and surrounding apparently normal (SAN) brain regions of glioblastoma, metastasis, and meningioma in humans with (1) H-MRSI to find biomarkers that can discriminate between tumors and characterize infiltrative tumor growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance (MR) spectra (semi-LASER MRSI, 30 msec echo time, 3T) were selected from regions of interest (ROIs) under MRI guidance, and after quality control of MR spectra. Statistical testing between patient groups was performed for mean metabolite ratios of an entire ROI and for the highest value within that ROI. RESULTS: The highest ratios of the level of choline compounds and the sum of myo-inositol and glycine over N-acetylaspartate and creatine compounds were significantly increased in PO regions of glioblastoma versus that of metastasis and meningioma. In the SAN region of glioblastoma some of these ratios were increased. Differences were less prominent for metabolite levels averaged over entire ROIs. CONCLUSION: Specific metabolite ratios in PO and SAN regions can be used to discriminate glioblastoma from metastasis and meningioma. An analysis of these ratios averaged over entire ROIs and those with most abnormal values indicates that infiltrative tumor growth in glioblastoma is inhomogeneous and extends into the SAN region. J.

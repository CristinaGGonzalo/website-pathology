## Abstract
This paper describes the simultaneous use of two, noninvasive, near-infrared techniques near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a continuous wave NIR laser Doppler flow system (LDF) to measure changes in the blood oxygenation, blood concentration and blood flow velocity in the brain. A piglet was used as animal model. A controlled change in the arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2) was applied for achieving changes in the listed cerebrovascular parameters. The time courses of blood concentration parameters (NIRS) and RMS blood flow velocity (LDF) were found to correspond closely with those of carotid blood flow and arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2). This result shows the additional value of LDF when combined with NIRS, preferably in one instrument. Development of pulsed LDF for regional blood flow measurement is indicated.

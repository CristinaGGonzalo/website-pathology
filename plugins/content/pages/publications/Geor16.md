## Abstract
Abstract. Today, breast surgeons plan their procedures using preoperatively placed metal clips or radioactive seeds and radiological images. These images show the breast in a positioning different from the one during surgery. We show a research prototype that eases the surgeon's planning task by providing 3D visualizations based on the radiological images. With a FEM-based deformation simulation, we mimic the real surgical scenario. In particular, we have developed a ligament model that increases the robustness of a fully automatic prone-supine deformation simulation, and we have developed specific visualization methods to aid intra-operative breast lesion localization.

## Abstract
Multiparametric MR (mpMR) imaging is rapidly evolving into the mainstay in prostate cancer (PCa) imaging. Generally, the examination consists of T2-weighted sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) evaluation, and less often proton MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI). Those functional techniques are related to biological properties of the tumor, so that DWI correlates to cellularity and Gleason scores, DCE correlates to angiogenesis, and MRSI correlates to cell membrane turnover. The combined use of those techniques enhances the diagnostic confidence and allows for better characterization of PCa. The present article reviews and illustrates the technical aspects and clinical applications of each component of mpMR imaging, in a practical approach from the urological standpoint.Abstract available from the publisher.

## Abstract
Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte disturbance among the elderly population today. It is defined as a state of diminished total body water content and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Such health outcomes highlight the urgent need for effective screening and prevention in the primary care arena. Myriad predisposing factors make the elderly more vulnerable to dehydration. On physical examination, many of the classic signs of dehydration may be present among normally hydrated older populations, highlighting the need for an age-appropriate assessment. In this regard, health care practitioners with a working knowledge of pertinent underlying pathophysiology and relevant predisposing factors will more readily identify high-risk clients and implement successful preventative strategies. Prompt intervention can dramatically affect health care outcomes among high-risk populations and go a long way in providing high-quality, cost-effective health care.

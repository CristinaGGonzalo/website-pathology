## Abstract
Image processing is a crucial element of modern digital mammography. Optimizing mammogram presentation may lead to more efficient reading and improved diagnostic performance. Despite that the effects of image processing are often much larger than those of acquisition parameter settings, little is known about how image processing can be optimized. Experts agree that comparison of features in various mammographic views is very important. This issue must be addressed by processing. Variation of image presentation across views and subsequent mammograms should be minimized. The dynamic range of electronic displays is limited. Therefore, processing techniques should be designed to limit the dynamic range of mammograms. This can effectively be done by applying peripheral enhancement in the uncompressed tissue region near the projected skin?air interface. Adaptive contrast enhancement can be applied to enhance micro-calcifications and dense tissue in the interior of the mammogram. Mammogram processing should be aimed at displaying all relevant information in good contrast simultaneously, as human interaction to manipulate contrast during reading is too time-consuming to be applied on a regular basis.

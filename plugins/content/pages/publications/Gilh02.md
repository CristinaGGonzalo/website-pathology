## Abstract
The authors developed a clinical system for computerized delineation, rating, and classification of breast lesions depicted in contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance images obtained in women with increased lifetime risk of breast cancer. Initial results showed negative predictive values above 98% at 50% positive predictive value with negligible interoperator differences. The system demonstrated potential to help exclude malignancy with high confidence and reproducibility with a positive predictive value that is acceptable in screening.

## Abstract
Intravascular ultrasound elastography is a method for measuring the local elastic properties of coronary atherosclerotic plaques using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Mechanical properties of the different tissues within a plaque are measured through strain. In the last decade, several groups have applied elastography intravascularly with various levels of success. In this paper, the approaches of the different research groups will be discussed and the focus will be on our approach to the application of intravascular elastography.

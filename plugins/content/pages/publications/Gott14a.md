## Abstract
The bimetallic metal-organic framework Cu-Ru-BTC with the stoichiometric formula Cu2.75Ru0.25(BTC)2Â·xH2O, which is isoreticular to HKUST-1, was successfully prepared in a direct synthesis using mild reaction conditions. The partial substitution of Cu(2+) by Ru(3+) centers in the paddlewheel structure and the absence of other Ru-containing phases was proven using X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

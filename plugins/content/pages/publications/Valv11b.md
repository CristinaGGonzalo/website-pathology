## Abstract
Precise lung perfusion quantification is essential for evaluation of patients with hemi-Fontan surgery. It is possible for two-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance phase contrast flow (two-dimensional flow) to evaluate non-invasively the systemic-to-pulmonary collateral blood flow. This case report intends to illustrate the benefit of four-dimensional flow over the current two-dimensional flow in the comprehensive assessment of hemi-Fontan patients

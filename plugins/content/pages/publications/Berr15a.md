## Abstract
Four patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies developed an isolated hyperbilirubinaemia following cytarabine- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The clinical picture was consistent with acalculous cholecystitis, but ultrasonography did not show the typical gallbladder wall thickening. All patients suffered from severe mucositis with neutropenic enterocolitis. We hypothesise that damage of the mucosa of the gallbladder induced by chemotherapy results in hyperpermeability of the mucosal barrier with bile leakage and isolated hyperbilirubinaemia.

title: Novel MR sequences for fast and robust metabolic imaging

## Isabell Steinseifer

## Abstract
MRS and MRSI are essential tools to assess metabolic processes in-vivo. They are widely used especially in preclinical and clinical research to investigate metabolism in general, but also disorders, like Alzheimer?s disease, diabetes,muscle diseases, cancer and inherited metabolic diseases. Not only the diseases themselves, but also their response to treatment can be evaluated by MRS(I) methods.

## Abstract
Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides preferentially bind to alphavbeta3 integrin, an integrin expressed on newly formed endothelial cells and on various tumor cells. When labeled with beta-emitting radionuclides, these peptides can be used for peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy of malignant tumors. These studies aimed to investigate whether tumor targeting and tumor therapy could be optimized by dose fractionation. The RGD-peptide DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was labeled with 111In for biodistribution experiments and with 90Y for therapy experiments. In mice with NIH:OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma xenografts, optimal tumor uptake was obtained at peptide doses up to 1.0 microg (4.8 %ID/g). A peptide dose of 5 microg, required to administer the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) 90Y-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2, was administered as 5 portions of 1.0 microg. Tumor uptake of the fifth portion was significantly higher than that of the single 5.0 microg portion (3.3 %ID/g versus 2.1 %ID/g). The therapeutic efficacy of 37 MBq 90Y-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 (1 x 5.0 microg) was compared with that of 37 MBq administered in five equal portions (5 x 1.0 microg). No difference in tumor growth between the fractionated and the nonfractionated therapy was observed. In conclusion, dose fractionation resulted in higher radiation doses. However, therapeutic efficacy of the radiolabeled peptide was not significantly improved by dose fractionation.

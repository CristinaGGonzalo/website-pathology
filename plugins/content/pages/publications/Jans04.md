title: Radiolabeled Antibodies and RGD-peptides for the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer

## Marcel Janssen

## Abstract
RIT and PRRT are potential strategies for the treatment of solid tumors. Although responses have been documented in patients with several tumor types, both treatments still have their limitations. New possibilities for both RIT as well as PRRT were evaluated in 5 preclinical studies that are described in this thesis. These studies adressed the following questions: 1) What is the most optimal radionuclide for HMFG1-based, intraperitoneal RIT? (Chapter 2), 2) Is radiolabeled RGD-peptide DOTA-E-(RGDfK)2 suitable for PRRI and PRRT in subcutaneous, ovarian carcinoma xenografts? (Chapter 3), 3) Can the radiation dose of 90Y-labeled RGD-peptide be predicted using 111In-labeled RGD-peptide as a surrogate? (Chapter 4), 4) Can tumor uptake be improved using a dimeric RGD-peptide instead of a monomeric RGD-peptide? (Chapter 5) and 5) Can rapid dose fractionation further improve tumor uptake and therapy results of 111In-DOTA-E-(RGDfK)2 and 90Y- DOTA-E-(RGDfK)2, respectively? (Chapter 6).

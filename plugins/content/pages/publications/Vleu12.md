## Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of embolization for treating the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). METHODS: Twenty-one women with PCS who were treated with embolization at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre between 2003 and 2008 were sent a questionnaire about their symptoms before embolization, 2months after the first embolization, and at the time the survey was conducted. RESULTS: All patients completed the questionnaire. Two months after the first embolization, 14 (66.7%) women had some degree of improvement of symptoms. Nine (42.9%) patients underwent a second embolization. At the time the survey was conducted, 16 (76.2%) patients had some degree of improvement of symptoms. In addition to improvements in varicose veins and pelvic pain, there was improvement of hemorrhoids. CONCLUSION: Embolization of pelvic varicosities may be an effective treatment in a well-selected group of patients with PCS. If there is no improvement of symptoms after initial embolization, a second procedure is unlikely to be effective.

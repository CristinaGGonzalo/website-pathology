## Abstract
In this review, several clinical applications of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) are updated. MR-guided FUS is used clinically for thermal ablation of uterine fibroids and bone metastases. Thousands of patients have successfully been treated. Transcranial MR-guided FUS has received CE certification for ablation of deep, central locations in the brain. Thermal ablation of specific parts of the thalamus can result in relief of the symptoms in a number of neurological disorders. Several approaches have been proposed for ablation of prostate and breast cancer and clinical trials should show the potential of MR-guided FUS for these and other applications.

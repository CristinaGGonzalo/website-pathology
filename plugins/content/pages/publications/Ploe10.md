## Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate anteroposterior instability in the CKS and the PFC total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs. Physical examinations, including VAS, IKS and WOMAC were performed in combination with a detailed fluoroscopic measurement technique for three-dimensional kinematic assessment of TKA design function. Anteroposterior instability rated with the IKS was not significantly different (p=0.34), but patients with a CKS design showed more limitations according to the WOMAC joint stiffness total score, and for items regarding higher flexion activities in the WOMAC score for knee disability. Kinematic analyses showed that the CKS design tended to have more anterior sliding of the femur on the tibia during mid- and deep flexion activities. The sliding distance was larger at the medial than at the lateral side. This phenomenon has also been described for posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees. Furthermore, the CKS design showed a significantly lower range of tibial rotation (p<0.05) from maximum extension to maximum flexion during deep knee bend activities. Kinematic differences can be ascribed to posterior cruciate ligament deficiency/laxity or differences in TKA designs.

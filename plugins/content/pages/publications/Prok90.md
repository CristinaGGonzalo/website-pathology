## Abstract
Diagnostic performance with storage phosphor radiography is influenced by exposure parameters and digital filtering algorithms. The authors compared the detectability of cortical lesions in excised human femoral shafts on state-of-the-art screen-film radiographs and storage phosphor digital radiographs. For the digital system, the effect of varying exposure parameters (photon flux and tube voltage) and unsharp mask filtering (kernel size and enhancement factor) was tested. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics was performed for 10,560 observations made by eight radiologists. Under identical exposure conditions, storage phosphor imaging yielded no significant advantages over conventional screen-film radiography. Although large variations in exposure dose are possible with storage phosphors, the potential for dose reduction was limited even by means of an increase in tube voltage. The performance with unsharp masked images declined with decreasing kernel size and pronounced enhancement.

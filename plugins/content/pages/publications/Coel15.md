## Abstract
Mice deficient in adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL(-/-)) present elevated ectopic lipid levels but are paradoxically glucose-tolerant. Measurement of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and Cori cycle activity provide insights into the maintenance of glycemic control in these animals. These parameters were determined in 7 wild-type (ATGL(+/-)) and 6 ATGL(-/-) mice by a primed-infusion of [U-(13)C6]glucose followed by LC-MS/MS targeted mass-isotopomer analysis of blood glucose. EGP was quantified by isotope dilution of [U-(13)C6]glucose while Cori cycling was estimated by analysis of glucose triose (13)C-isotopomers. Fasting plasma free fatty-acids were significantly lower in ATGL(-/-) versus control mice (0.43 Â± 0.05 mM versus 0.73 Â± 0.11 mM, P < 0.05). Six-hour fasting EGP rates were identical for both ATGL(-/-) and control mice (79 Â± 11 versus 71 Â± 7 Î¼mol/kg/min, resp.). Peripheral glucose metabolism was dominated by Cori cycling (80 Â± 2% and 82 Â± 7% of glucose disposal for ATGL(-/-) and control mice, resp.) indicating that peripheral glucose oxidation was not significantly upregulated in ATGL(-/-) mice under these conditions. The glucose (13)C-isotopomer distributions in both ATGL(-/-) and control mice were consistent with extensive hepatic pyruvate recycling. This suggests that gluconeogenic outflow from the Krebs cycle was also well compensated in ATGL(-/-) mice.

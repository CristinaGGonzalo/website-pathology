## Abstract
MRSI provides MR spectra from multiple adjacent voxels within a body volume represented as a two- or three-dimensional matrix, allowing the measurement of the distribution of metabolites over this volume. The spectra of these voxels are usually analyzed one by one, without exploiting their spatial context. In this article, we present an advanced metabolite quantification method for MRSI data, in which the available spatial information is considered. A nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed in which prior knowledge is included in the form of proximity constraints on the spectral parameters within a grid and optimized starting values. A penalty term that promotes a spatially smooth spectral parameter map is added to the fitting algorithm. This method is adaptive, in the sense that several sweeps through the grid are performed and each solution may tune some hyperparameters at run-time. Simulation studies of MRSI data showed significantly improved metabolite estimates after the inclusion of spatial information. Improved metabolite maps were also demonstrated by applying the method to in vivo MRSI data. Overlapping peaks or peaks of compounds present at low concentration can be better quantified with the proposed method than with single-voxel approaches. The new approach compares favorably against the multivoxel approach embedded in the well-known quantification software LCModel. Copyright ï¿½ 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

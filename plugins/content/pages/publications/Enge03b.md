## Abstract
In this study we investigate two ways of presenting prior and current mammograms on a mammography workstation: next to each other and alternating at the same display (toggle). The experiment consisted of 420 trials with prior-current mammogram pairs, displayed on a dedicated mammography workstation. In two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) experiment, observers were asked to select the image containing the largest lesion. The stimuli were created by pasting extracted lesions into normal mammograms. Results showed that the observers preformed more accurate in selecting the largest lesion when using the toggle option.

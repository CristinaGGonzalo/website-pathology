## Abstract
The aim of our study was to provide a systematic literature review of clinical studies on pelvic organ prolapse staging with use of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.The databases EMBASE and PubMed were searched. Clinical studies were included in case they compared pelvic organ prolapse stages as assessed on dynamic MR imaging (using a reference line) with a standardized method of clinical prolapse staging.Ten studies were included, which made use of seven different reference lines in relation to a wide variety of anatomical landmarks.Only few studies have compared pelvic organ prolapse stages as assessed by dynamic MR imaging and clinical examination in a standardized manner. The available evidence suggests that prolapse assessment on dynamic MR imaging may be useful in the posterior compartment, but clinical assessment and dynamic MR imaging seem interchangeable in the anterior and central compartment.

## Abstract
A rare case of aseptic thrombosis of the left vein of LabbÃ© in a young woman is reported. Cerebral venous thrombosis was suggested by computed tomography and confirmed after intravenous administration of contrast by computed tomography venography. The combination of the clinical setting with the findings on the non-enhanced CT may favour the diagnosis of vein of LabbÃ© thrombosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed on computed tomography venography.

## Abstract
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the Western world. Most colorectal cancers show fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, although in mucinous adenocarcinoma uptake may be limited. A literature search was conducted regarding the impact of FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) on management and outcome in patients with colorectal carcinoma. FDG-PET/CT can have a significant clinical impact on patient management in various stages of the disease. In patients with suspected recurrent disease and patients with liver metastases who might be eligible for surgery FDG-PET/CT can have more benefit than conventional imaging. FDG-PET/CT can be a useful modality to monitor treatment response.

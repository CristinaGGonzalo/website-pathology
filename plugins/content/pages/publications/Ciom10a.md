## Abstract
We present a meta-learning framework for the design of potential functions for Conditional Random Fields. The design of both node potential and edge potential is formulated as a classification problem where margin classifiers are used. The set of state transitions for the edge potential is treated as a set of different classes, thus defining a multiclass learning problem. The Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) technique is used to deal with the multi-class problem. Furthermore, the point defined by the combination of margin classifiers in the ECOC space is interpreted in a probabilistic manner, and the obtained distance values are then converted into potential values. The proposed model exhibits very promising results when applied to two real detection problems.

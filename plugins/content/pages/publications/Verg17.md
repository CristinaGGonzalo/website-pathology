## Abstract
Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a versatile, non-destructive and non-invasive tool in life, material, and medical sciences. When multiple components contribute to the signal in a single pixel, however, it is difficult to quantify their individual contributions and characteristic parameters. Here we introduce the concept of phasor representation to qMRI to disentangle the signals from multiple components in imaging data. Plotting the phasors allowed for decomposition, unmixing, segmentation and quantification of our in vivo data from a plant stem, a human and mouse brain and a human prostate. In human brain images, we could identify 3 main T 2 components and 3 apparent diffusion coefficients; in human prostate 5 main contributing spectral shapes were distinguished. The presented phasor analysis is model-free, fast and accurate. Moreover, we also show that it works for undersampled data.

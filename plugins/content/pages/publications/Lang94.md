## Abstract
We report on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings in 45 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology at the time of liver transplantation (n = 37) or shunt surgery (n = 8). An underlying disorder could be established only in half of the patients, oral contraceptives as predisposing factor were known in 18 cases. Clinically, abdominal pain and distension as well as hepatomegaly and ascites were most frequent findings, whereas changes in laboratory data were more or less unspecific. By use of repeated ultrasound, a definite diagnosis of a Budd-Chiari syndrome could be confirmed in all cases by obligatory demonstration of obstruction or thrombosis of at least one major liver vein. Hepatic venography revealed only one false-negative result. Celio-mesenteric arteriography plus portography, cavography and preoperative liver biopsy did not present additional diagnostic information. These techniques may contribute to treatment planning of portosystemic shunt surgery or hepatic transplantation. In conclusion, the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, abdominal pain and distension, especially in combination with a known hypercoagulable state, should alert to the possibility of a Budd-Chiari syndrome. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool of choice. Hepatic venography should only be performed if even repeated ultrasound is not conclusive.

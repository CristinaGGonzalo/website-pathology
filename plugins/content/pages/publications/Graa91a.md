## Abstract
Conformational studies were performed on a synthetic pentacosapeptide representing the RNA-binding N-terminal region of the coat protein of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus. The effects of ionic strength, addition of (oligo)phosphates and temperature on the conformation of this highly positively charged peptide containing six arginines and three lysines were studied. CD experiments show that the peptide has 15-18% alpha-helical conformation and about 80% random-coil conformation in the absence of inorganic salt at 25 degrees C, and 20-21% alpha-helical conformation under the same conditions at 10 degrees C. Addition of inorganic salts results in an increase of alpha-helix content, up to 42% in the presence of oligophosphate with an average chain length of 18 phosphates, which was used as an RNA analog. NMR experiments show that the alpha-helix formation starts in the region between Thr9 and Gln12, and is extended in the direction of the C terminus. Relaxation measurements show that binding to oligophosphates of increasing length results in reduced internal mobilities of the positively charged side chains of the arginyl and lysyl residues and of the side chain of Thr9 in the alpha-helical region. The alpha-helix formation in the N-terminal part of this viral coat protein upon binding of phosphate groups to the positively charged side chains is suggested to play an essential role in RNA binding.

## Abstract
Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy is the gold standard for prostate cancer detection. The latter detection rates of random systematic TRUS-guided biopsy do not exceed 44%. As a consequence other biopsy methods have been explored. One of these methods is MR-guided biopsy (MRGB), which revealed detection rates of 38-59% after previous negative TRUSGB sessions. For this reason MRGB will probably become more and more applied in daily practice.

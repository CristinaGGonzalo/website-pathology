## Abstract
We retrospectively reviewed our experience with subintimal angioplasty for chronic limb ischemia. Hospital records and films of all subintimal angioplasty procedures performed between October 2002 and December 2004 were reviewed and analyzed for demographic data, clinical data, and comorbid condition status. Thirty-nine subintimal angioplasties were performed in 37 patients (65% male, 35% female), with a median age of 73 years. Median follow-up was 9 months. The 30-day mortality rate was 8%. All-cause mortality was 33% after 24 months. In 23 cases (59%), a subintimal angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) alone was performed. Both the SFA and popliteal/crural vessels were used in nine limbs (23%), the popliteal artery alone in three limbs (8%), and the crural arteries alone in four limbs (10%). Initial technical and clinical success rates were 67% and 49%, respectively. The complication rate was 28%. Twenty-four additional surgical interventions were performed after the initial angioplasty procedure, of which 12 were major amputations. Amputation-free survival (limb-salvage rate) was 69% at 12 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 52-85%], and overall survival was 69% (95% CI 52-85%) at 12 months. In patients with critical limb ischemia, subintimal angioplasty is feasible and in most cases technically successful. In these high-risk patients, often with combined cardiac, pulmonary, and diabetic risk and considered unfit for bypass surgery, subintimal angioplasty offers a safe and effective alternative.

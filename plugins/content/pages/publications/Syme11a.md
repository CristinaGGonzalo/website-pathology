## Abstract
OBJECTIVES: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can detect the cause of prosthetic heart valve (PHV) dysfunction but is hampered by valve-induced artifacts. We quantified artifacts of four PHV using a pulsatile in-vitro model and assessed the relation to leaflet motion and valve design. METHODS: A Medtronic Hall tilting disc (MH), and Carbomedics (CM), St Jude (SJM), and ON-X bileaflet valves underwent CT in an in-vitro model using retrospective gating with a 64 detector CT system in stationary and pulsatile conditions. Artifacts and radiopaque component volumes were quantified with thresholds based on surrounding structures and valvular components. RESULTS: Hypodense artifacts volumes (mm(3)) were 1,029???147, 535???53, 371???16, and 366???18 for the SJM, MH, CM and ON-X valves (p?<?0.001 except for the latter two valves p?=?0.43). Hyperdense artifact volumes were 3,546???141, 2,387???103, 2,003???102, and 3,033???31 for the SJM, MH, CM and ON-X valve, respectively (all differences p?<?0.001). Leaflet motion affected hypodense (F?=?41.5, p?<?0.001) and hyperdense artifacts (F?=?53.7, p?<?0.001). Closed and moving leaflets were associated with the least and the most artifacts respectively (p?<?0.001, both artifact types). CONCLUSION: Both valve design and leaflet motion affect PHV-induced artifacts. Best imaging results may be expected for the CM valve during phases in which the leaflets are closed.

## Abstract
Compare the right ventricle to left ventricle (RV/LV) diameter ratio obtained from axial pulmonary CT angiograms (CTPA) with those derived from automatically generated 4-chamber (4-CH) reformats in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).In this institutional review board-approved study we included 120 consecutive non ECG-gated CTPA from 3 institutions (mean age 60ï¿½16 years; 71 women). Twenty 64-slice CTPA with PE and 20 without PE were selected per institution. For each patient the RV/LV diameter ratio was obtained from both axial CTPA images and automatically generated 4-CH reformats. Measurements were performed twice in two separated sessions by 2 experienced radiologists and 2 residents. The differences between the measurements on both views were evaluated.The 4-CH view was successfully obtained in 113 patients. The mean axial and 4-CH diameter ratios were comparable for three of the four readers (p=0.56, p=0.13, p=0.08). Although the mean diameters (1.0 and 1.03 respectively) for one resident were significantly different (p=0.013), the difference of 0.03 seems negligible in clinical routine. Three readers achieved equally high intra-reader agreements with both measurements (ICCs of 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96), while one reader showed a different variability with ICCs of 0.96 for the axial view and 0.91 for the 4-CH view. The inter-reader agreement was equally high for both measurement types with ICCs of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively.In patients with suspected PE, RV/LV diameters ratio can be measured with the same reproducibility and accuracy using an automatically generated 4-CH view compared to the axial view.

## Abstract
Aneurysm formation, restenosis, and hypertension are well known complications after surgery for coarctation of the aorta (CoA). In order to assess long-term results, 46 patients were studied by spiral computed tomography and three-dimensional reconstruction after an interval ranging from 1 to 21 years (median 10 years) after surgery for coarctation. Spiral computed tomography showed pathological changes of the aorta in the majority of patients. Typical findings were ectasy or aneurysm formation of the ascending aorta, hypoplastic aortic arch, ectasy or aneurysm formation of the supraaortic vessels, circumscript aneurysm of the descending aorta at the side of surgery, restenosis of the descending aorta and malformations and anomalies of arterial vessels. In order to initiate adequate treatment of such specific complications as restenosis, aneurysm and/or arterial hypertension, regular controls are necessary in patients after surgery for aortic coarctation. In addition to clinical examination and besides magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, spiral computed tomography is an effective non-invasive imaging method for follow-up.

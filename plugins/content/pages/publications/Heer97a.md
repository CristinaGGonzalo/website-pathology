## Abstract
This report describes the use of an endorectal coil and a double spin-echo pulse sequence for localized 1H MR spectroscopy of the normal prostate in volunteers. The spectra showed well-resolved signals for citrate, (phospho)choline, and creatine protons. Additional signals were assigned to taurine and myoinositol protons. J modulation of the main and outer peaks of citrate could be monitored in vivo. Apparent relaxation times T1 and T2 have been estimated for the methyl protons of cholines and creatine. An effective T1 relaxation time was estimated for the main peaks of the citrate multiplet. Ratios of the integrals of these resonances have been evaluated, and tissue contents of choline and creatine were estimated using the H2O signal as an internal reference. Spectroscopic imaging experiments revealed a lower relative citrate signal in central parts of the prostate than in peripheral parts.

## Abstract
To evaluate the additional value of the color coding of dynamic data using the 3TP method in the evaluation of contrast-enhanced breast MRI for readers with different levels of experience.A total of 52 lesions were included in this study, 25 malignant and 27 benign. All lesions were evaluated by four readers on two different workstations for the evaluation of dynamic breast MRI; one displaying the subtracted images and relative enhancement versus time curves and one displaying the subtracted images together with the 3TP color coding projected onto pre-contrast T1 images. Readers with different levels of experience were used. The diagnostic performance of both workstations was evaluated using ROC curve analyses. Interobserver variations were evaluated using kappa statistics.All lesions were detected by all four readers on both workstations. The diagnostic performance found in the inexperienced readers improved significantly when using the 3TP evaluations (p=0.04 and p=0.03). No significant difference was found for the more experienced readers (p=0.94 and p=0.54). The level of agreement between the readers improved significantly when using the 3TP evaluation method (p=0.01).Even though the 3TP color coding did not improve the diagnostic performance of the more experienced readers, this study clearly shows its value for inexperienced readers. The use of 3TP color coding is therefore recommended for inexperienced readers.

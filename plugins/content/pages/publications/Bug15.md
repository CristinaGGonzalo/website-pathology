## Abstract
Segmentation of histopathological whole-slide images is a challenging task that requires dedicated approaches. In this paper, the fore- and background segmentation problem is addressed by a combi- nation of basic filters, which is evaluated against the established meth- ods GrabCut and Watershed. It is shown that our computationally ef- ficient, dedicated approach performs better than the technically more advanced methods. The main lesson is that dedicated solutions built on prior knowledge can out-compete advanced algorithms.

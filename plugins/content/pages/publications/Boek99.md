## Abstract
The major lens protein alpha-crystallin is composed of two related types of subunits, alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin, of which the former is essentially lens-restricted, while the latter also occurs in various other tissues. With regard to their respective chaperone capacities, it has been reported that homomultimeric alphaA-crystallin complexes perform better in preventing thermal aggregation of proteins, while alphaB-crystallin complexes protect more efficiently against reduction-induced aggregation of proteins. Here, we demonstrate that this seeming discrepancy is solved when the reduction assay is performed at increasing temperatures: above 50 degrees C alphaA- performs better than alphaB-crystallin also in this assay. This inversion in protective capacity might relate to the greater resistance of alphaA-crystallin to heat denaturation. Infrared spectroscopy, however, revealed that this is not due to a higher thermostability of alphaA-crystallin's secondary structure. Also the accessible hydrophobic surfaces do not account for the chaperoning differences of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin, since regardless of the experimental temperature alphaB-crystallin displays a higher hydrophobicity. It is argued that the greater complex stability of alphaA-crystallin, as evident upon urea denaturation, and the higher chaperone capacity of alphaB-crystallin at physiological temperatures reflect the evolutionary compromise to obtain an optimal functioning of heteromeric alpha-crystallin as a lens protein.

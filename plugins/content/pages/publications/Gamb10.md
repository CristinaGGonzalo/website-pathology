## Abstract
The objective of this study is to assess whether ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-induced changes of the water proton longitudinal relaxation rate (R(1)) provide a means to assess blood hemodynamics of tumors. Two types of murine colon tumors (C26a and C38) were investigated prior to and following administration of USPIO blood-pool contrast agent with fast R(1) measurements. In a subpopulation of mice, R(1) was measured following administration of hydralazine, a well-known blood hemodynamic modifier. USPIO-induced R(1) increase in C38 tumors (DeltaR(1) = 0.072 +/- 0.0081 s(-1)) was significantly larger than in C26a tumors (DeltaR(1) = 0.032 +/- 0.0018 s(-1), N = 9, t test, P < 0.001). This was in agreement with the immunohistochemical data that showed higher values of relative vascular area (RVA) in C38 tumors than in C26a tumors (RVA = 0.059 +/- 0.015 vs. 0.020 +/- 0.011; P < 0.05). Following administration of hydralazine, a decrease in R(1) value was observed. This was consistent with the vasoconstriction induced by the steal effect mechanism. In conclusion, R(1) changes induced by USPIO are sensitive to tumor vascular morphology and to blood hemodynamics. Thus, R(1) measurements following USPIO administration can give novel insight into the effects of blood hemodynamic modifiers, non-invasively and with a high temporal resolution.

## Abstract
NLRP3-inflammasome activates caspase-1 and processes pro-IL-1Î² and pro-IL-18 into the active cytokines. Two recent studies describe specific inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome that inhibit IL-1Î² release and inflammation. The specificity and potency of these compounds gives hope that a targeted approach to inhibit NLRP3-driven inflammation may be just around the corner.

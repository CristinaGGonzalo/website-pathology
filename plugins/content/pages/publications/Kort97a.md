## Abstract
The mechanical and acoustic properties of agar-gelatin gels, used to construct vessel mimicking phantoms for ultrasonic elasticity studies, were investigated. Gels with varying compression moduli were made using a gelatin solution (8% by weight) with a variable amount of agar (1%-3% by weight). Carborundum particles were added as scattering material. The compression modulus was determined using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. The dependence of the compression modulus and the acoustic parameters on the agar concentration, as well as on the age and the temperature of the samples, was investigated. The results show that the compression modulus is strongly influenced by these factors, while the effect on the acoustic parameters is less. Compression moduli spanning a useful range for vascular phantom construction with realistic acoustic parameters can be achieved by varying the amount of agar. Phantoms constructed from these gels are well suited to serve as a model for plaque containing vessels.

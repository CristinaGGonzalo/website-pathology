## Abstract
The accuracy of volume measurement using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) in comparison to three-dimensional computer tomography (3D-CT) was evaluated in 11 patients. The deviation of tumor volumes measured with 3D-US (ellipsoid formula) from 3D-CT was -28% to +9% and for 3D-US (planimetry reconstruction) from 3D-CT was -21% to +9%. These data show that volume measurement using 3D-US provides comparable results to 3D-CT. Clinically, 3D-US could be helpful in the follow-up of patients with non-resectable tumors or in planning liver resections by assessing the volume of liver tissue remaining after resection or by a better visualization of the topography of liver tumors and major hepatic structures.

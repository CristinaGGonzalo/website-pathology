## Abstract
In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of human fetal brain was performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Spectra were obtained showing signals assigned to cerebral compounds such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and cholines. Relative signal intensities were similar to those observed in neonatal brain spectra recorded during the early postnatal stage.

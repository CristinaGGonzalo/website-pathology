## Abstract
A new model-free method is presented that automatically corrects for phase shifts, frequency shifts, and additional lineshape distortions of one single resonance peak across a series of in vivo NMR spectra. All separate phase and frequency variations are quickly and directly derived from the common lineshape in the data set using principal component analysis and linear regression. First, the new approach is evaluated on simulated data in order to quantitatively assess the phase and frequency shifts which can be removed by the proposed correction procedure. Subsequently, the value of the method is demonstrated on in vivo (31)P NMR spectra from skeletal muscle of the hind leg of the mouse focusing on the phosphocreatine resonance which is distorted by the experimental procedure. Phase shifts, frequency shifts, and lineshape distortions with respect to the common lineshape in the spectral data set could successfully be removed.

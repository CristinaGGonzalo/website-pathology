## Abstract
Aim: To determine whether a) increasing numbers of readers and b) methods of arbitration significantly influence nodule detection. Methods: 85 CTs performed as part of the NELSON lung cancer screening trial were read by five experienced thoracic radiologists twice. During the first reading, radiologists classified all opacities as positive (nodules>3mm) or negative (non-nodular opacities and nodules <3mm). In the second reading, each radiologist categorised the opacities identified by the other radiologists. Readers' final scores were combined to simulate double- and triple-reading. For double-reading, if there was disagreement a third independent reader provided arbitration. For triple-reading, >=2 radiologists in agreement constituted a positive reading. The reference standard was agreement by >=4 radiologists. Results: 531 opacities were identified, of which 186 (35.0%) nodules met reference standard criteria. Double-reading without arbitration had a variable impact on nodule detection: there was a significant increase in mean sensitivity (22.6%, p<0.005) and specificity (11.3%, p<0.05) in 5 and 16 pairs respectively, a significant reduction in mean sensitivity (20.7%, p<0.005) in 2 pairs, and no change in mean sensitivity and specificity in 13 and 4 pairs respectively. Triple-reading or double-reading with arbitration significantly increased mean sensitivity in 29/30 triple-reader combinations (24.5%, p<0.05) and 6/10 pairs (17.7%, p<0.05) respectively, but there was a significantly decreased mean specificity in 26/30 triple-reader combinations (11.3%, p<0.05) and 10/10 pairs respectively (11.7%, p<0.0005). Conclusions: Double-reading does not invariably improve nodule detection accuracy for experienced thoracic radiologists. However improved sensitivity is achieved by triple-reading or double-reading with independent arbitration, at the expense of reduced specificity.

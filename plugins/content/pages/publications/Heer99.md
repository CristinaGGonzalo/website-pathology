## Abstract
31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers a unique non-invasive window on energy metabolism in skeletal muscle, with possibilities for longitudinal studies and of obtaining important bioenergetic data continuously and with sufficient time resolution during muscle exercise. The present paper provides an introductory overview of the current status of in vivo 31P MRS of skeletal muscle, focusing on human applications, but with some illustrative examples from studies on transgenic mice. Topics which are described in the present paper are the information content of the 31P magnetic resonance spectrum of skeletal muscle, some practical issues in the performance of this MRS methodology, related muscle biochemistry and the validity of interpreting results in terms of biochemical processes, the possibility of investigating reaction kinetics in vivo and some indications for fibre-type heterogeneity as seen in spectra obtained during exercise.

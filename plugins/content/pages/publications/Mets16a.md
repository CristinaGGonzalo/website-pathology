## Abstract
To determine the presence and morphology of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) in a non-screening setting and relate them to clinical and patient characteristics.A total of 16,890 reports of clinically obtained chest CT (06/2011 to 11/2014, single-centre) were searched describing an SSN. Subjects with a visually confirmed SSN and at least two thin-slice CTs were included. Nodule volumes were measured. Progression was defined as volume increase exceeding the software interscan variation. Nodule morphology, location, and patient characteristics were evaluated.Fifteen transient and 74 persistent SSNs were included (median follow-up 19.6 [8.3-36.8] months). Subjects with an SSN were slightly older than those without (62 vs. 58ï¿½years; p?=?0.01), but no gender predilection was found. SSNs were mostly located in the upper lobes. Women showed significantly more often persistent lesions than men (94ï¿½% vs. 69ï¿½%; p?=?0.002). Part-solid lesions were larger (1638 vs. 383ï¿½mm(3); p?<?0.001) and more often progressive (68ï¿½% vs. 38ï¿½%; p?=?0.02), compared to pure ground-glass nodules. Progressive SSNs were rare under the age of 50ï¿½years. Logistic regression analysis did not identify additional nodule parameters of future progression, apart from part-solid nature.This study confirms previously reported characteristics of SSNs and associated factors in a European, routine clinical population.? SSNs in women are significantly more often persistent compared to men. ? SSN persistence is not associated with age or prior malignancy. ? The majority of (persistent) SSNs are located in the upper lung lobes. ? A part-solid nature is associated with future nodule growth. ? Progressive solitary SSNs are rare under the age of 50ï¿½years.

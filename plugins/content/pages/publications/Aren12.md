## Abstract
A 62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer was referred for an (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan. She had an active upper respiratory infection at the time of examination. An FDG avid (SUV(max) = 7.7) middle turbinate was identified, correlating with an inflamed concha bullosa. A short review of concha bullosa is given.

title: Quantitative characterisation of solid tumours by 18F-FDG PET. What's in a number?

## Dennis Vriens

## Abstract
Three diagnostic challenges will be addressed in this thesis, (1) the influence of different methods for data-analysis on measured metabolic therapy response and their effect on its relation with clinical outcome, (2) metabolic and vascular characterisation of lesions and (3) clinical and economical impact of the use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT for tissue characterisation. These issues were studied in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and thyroid nodules suspected for differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

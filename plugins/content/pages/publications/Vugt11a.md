## Abstract
BACKGROUND:: Thoracoabdominal MultiDetector-row Computed Tomography (MDCT) is frequently used as a diagnostic tool in trauma patients. One potential side-effect of performing MDCT is the detection of incidental findings and their subsequent consequences on medical treatment. The objective was to evaluate frequency and effects of incidental findings in trauma patients. METHODS:: The reports of 1,047 consecutive blunt trauma patients (mean age, 40 years) who underwent routine contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal MDCT were evaluated. Incidental findings were categorized by a trauma radiologist into four hierarchic categories based on their clinical consequences. We recorded additional diagnostic workup and treatment performed in conjunction with these incidental findings. RESULTS:: Of the 1,047 patients, 372 (mean age, 56 years; 61% male) had one or more incidental findings on thoracoabdominal MDCT. Complementary investigation or therapy was performed in 72 of these 372 patients; 29 of these patients required additional invasive evaluation or treatment. Nineteen patients underwent surgery due to an incidental finding. Nine patients were diagnosed with a not previously identified malignancy. CONCLUSIONS:: Routine thoracoabdominal MDCT in the evaluation of trauma patients revealed a significant number of incidental findings. Based on radiologic findings it is possible to decide whether additional follow-up or treatment is necessary.

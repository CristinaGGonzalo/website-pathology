## Abstract
The detection of the position of the normal anatomy in color fundus photographs is an important step in the automated analysis of retinal images. An automatic system for the detection of the position of the optic disc and the fovea is presented. The method integrates the use of local vessel geometry and image intensity features to find the correct positions in the image. A kNN regressor is used to accomplish the integration. Evaluation was performed on a set of 250 digital color fundus photographs and the detection performance for the optic disc and the fovea were 99.2% and 96.4% respectively.

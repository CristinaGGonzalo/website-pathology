## Abstract
Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, may be beneficial in the treatment of head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs).We conducted a nonblinded, prospective intervention study. During 1 year, patients received a monthly intramuscular injection of 30 mg octreotide. Pretreatment and posttreatment tumor volumes were assessed by MRI, urinary catecholamine secretion was measured, and HNPGL-related signs and symptoms were recorded.In 1 of 4 included patients with HNPGL, a stabilization of tumor growth was observed after octreotide therapy. In 1 patient, octreotide therapy was discontinued before the end of the study because of potential side effects. No improvements in HNPGL-related signs and symptoms were observed.In 1 of 4 patients, HNPGL tumor growth velocity was reduced after octreotide therapy. Research assessing the effects of somatostatin analogues targeting different somatostatin receptor subtypes or combined with other therapies may offer new possibilities for the treatment of HNPGLs.

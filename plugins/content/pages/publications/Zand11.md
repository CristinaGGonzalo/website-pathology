## Abstract
There is an evident clinical need for artificial bone restorative materials. In this respect, novel composites based on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) have been described. The bone response of such polymer-based composites is usually improved by the addition of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). However, released BMP-2 is cleared almost immediately from the site of implantation by diffusion, whereas a prolonged retention of BMP-2 onto the scaffold has been suggested to be more favourable. Besides the ability to improve the mechanical strength and osteoconductivity of polymeric scaffolds, both carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and microhydroxyapatite (ÂµHA) have been described to facilitate such retention of BMP-2 when incorporated into a composite scaffold. Therefore, in the current study, radiolabelled BMP-2 was loaded onto plain PLLA and composite PLLA-CNT-ÂµHA scaffolds. Subsequently, the scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously for 5 weeks in rats and BMP-2 release was measured. Release started with an initial phase of quick release, followed by a gradual release of BMP-2. Both scaffold types comprised the same in vivo release properties for BMP-2. The bioactivity of the BMP-2 remained unaltered. It can be concluded that incorporated CNTs and ÂµHA did not affect BMP-2 release from composite scaffold materials.

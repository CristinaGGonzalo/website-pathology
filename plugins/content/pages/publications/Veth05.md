## Abstract
Cryosurgery is a method of treatment for various tumours that induces tissue necrosis with ablative intent. It is used in benign, aggressive, and low-grade malignant bone tumours such as chondrosarcoma grade 1. We describe the history of the technique and the issues associated with cryobiology, as well as the indications, technique, complications, and results of cryosurgery. At the University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Netherlands, 302 tumours have been treated by use of cryosurgery with at least 2 years' follow-up. 96-100% of patients were cured-the response depended on tumour type. Comparison of functional results with data from studies shows that these results concur with other studies on cryosurgery, and are at least equal to results of marginal excision and mostly better than those of wide excisions of grade 1 chondrosarcomas. Thus from an oncological point of view, cryosurgery combined with intralesional excision is equal to marginal excision.

## Abstract
Several hundred storage phosphor digital projection radiography (DR) systems are in operation in many parts of the world in experimental and clinical settings. They are used clinically for almost all projection radiographic studies except mammography. An overview is given of the experimental and clinical results achieved so far. Image post-processing has yet to meet the initial expectations. The average image quality will certainly improve with automatic brightness control. Edge enhancement should be performed in selected applications only. A true increase in diagnostic information probably cannot be expected except with dual energy techniques. Dose reductions are possible only in those studies in which the specific imaging task permits a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio.

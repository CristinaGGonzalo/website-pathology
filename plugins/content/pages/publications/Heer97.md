## Abstract
Recently the potential of magnetic resonance (MR) methods for non-invasive diagnosis and therapy evaluation of prostate cancer has improved substantially. In this study proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS) was explored for the detection of cancer in the prostate. Patients and Methods: Employing an endorectal probe localized 1H MRS and contrast enhanced MR imaging was performed on the prostate of healthy volunteers and of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostate cancer (PCa).1H MR spectra of the human prostate showed major signals for citrate, creatine and choline compounds. For cancer tissue the average citrate/choline signal ratio was significantly lower than for BPH and non-cancerous peripheral and central zone tissue, but individual ratios overlapped with ratios for normal central zone and BPH tissue. Low citrate/choline ratios in tumour tissue correspond with early MR contrast enhancement.1H MRS has potential for non-invasive detection and follow-up of tumours in the prostate.

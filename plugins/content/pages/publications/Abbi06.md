## Abstract
Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCH) is associated with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment of FCH patients might increase insulin sensitivity, but may also improve serum lipid levels, body fat distribution, intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) and endothelial function.Double blind, randomized, cross-over study.Seventeen FCH patients.Sixteen weeks of pioglitazone treatment (30 mg) compared with 16 weeks of placebo.Insulin sensitivity was measured using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp procedure, body fat distribution and IMCL using magnetic resonance techniques and endothelial function using flow-mediated vasodilatation.Pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity (M value 37.7 +/- 3.6 micromol min(-1) kg(-1) vs. 33.0 +/- 3.3 micromol min(-1) kg(-1) during placebo, P < 0.05) and LDL composition by increasing the K value (-0.11 +/- 0.06 vs. -0.20 +/- 0.06 during placebo, P < 0.05). However, pioglitazone did not affect other serum lipid levels. Endothelial function, body fat distribution and IMCL were also not affected. In addition, pioglitazone was associated with a decrease in liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase).Pioglitazone treatment of FCH patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus increases insulin sensitivity, decreases liver enzymes and improves LDL composition but has a neutral effect on total serum lipid levels. The change in insulin sensitivity might be too small to induce changes in endothelial function, body fat distribution and IMCL.

## Abstract
Long-term outcome and quality of life in omphalocele (OC) studies are mainly focused on cosmetic disorders with the abdominal scar and gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to compare long-term mortality, morbidity, and quality of life between patients with minor and giant OCs.Records of 89 minor and 22 giant OC children were reviewed. A questionnaire on general health was sent to all patients. A second questionnaire concerning quality of life and functional status; Darthmouth COOP Functional Health Assessment Charts/WONCA (COOP/WONCA) was sent to all patients aged 18 years or older and a peer control group.Of the surviving patients (69 minor OC, 20 giant OC), 12 were lost to hospital follow-up. The first questionnaire was returned by 64 (83%) of 77 patients. There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal disorders. Cosmetic problems were experienced significantly more in giant OC. The results of the COOP/WONCA charts indicated a good to very good quality of life in both groups comparable to the control group.Our study indicates that after a high level of medical intervention perinatally, quality of life is good to very good in both groups and comparable to healthy young adults.

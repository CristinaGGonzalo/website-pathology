## Abstract
The treatment of metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) still represents a formidable challenge, despite the development of small molecule, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that have made a major impact on the disease. Although the percentage of patients achieving a partial response or stabilization of disease has been impressive, these effects are mostly non-durable. Additionally, drug-related side effects can be quite severe. Alternative treatment modalities might be monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). mAbs against RCC-associated antigens have been developed and have shown promise. Additionally, current efforts focus on Bevacizumab that recognizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF overexpression in RCC provides the opportunity to inhibit this proangiogenic pathway. Also with Bevacizumab, promising results have been obtained, particularly in combination with other treatment modalities. It is likely that mAbs, either as single agents or in combination with other agents, may become useful additions to the armamentarium to diagnose and treat RCC.

## Abstract
Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is a valuable method for the detection of somatostatin receptor-positive lesions. Most gastrinomas (over-)express the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 which can be targeted by In-111 labeled Octreotide. Different studies show a high sensitivity of SRS for the localization and staging of gastrinomas. SRS seems to be superior to other non-invasive imaging modalities and has been proven to significantly contribute to patient management. However, the sensitivity depends on the size and exact localization of the tumors. Smaller lesions and lesions located in the duodenum show a significantly lower sensitivity. In any case, SRS belongs to the routine imaging procedure for gastrinomas for localization and staging and can also be used for evaluation of the tumor progression.

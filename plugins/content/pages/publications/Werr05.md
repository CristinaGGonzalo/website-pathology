## Abstract
Surgical repair of penetrating injuries of the thoracic outlet with combined arterial and venous involvement is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency room with a left-sided penetrating zone I neck injury caused by a close-range handgun shot. This had resulted in an injury to the innominate artery and the origin of the right common carotid artery, with shunting to the brachiocephalic vein. This was managed endovascularly by stenting of the innominate artery and by coiling of the origin of the carotid artery. An endovascular approach to this injury is feasible and has the advantage of appropriate visualization of the vascular lesions with limited blood loss during the repair.

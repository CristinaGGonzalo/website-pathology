## Abstract
In recent years, a new method to measure transverse blood flow, based on the decorrelation of the radio frequency (RF) signals has been developed. In this paper, we investigated the influence of nonuniform flow on the velocity estimation. The decorrelation characteristics of transverse blood flow using an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) array catheter are studied by means of computer modeling. Blood was simulated as a collection of randomly located point scatterers; moving this scattering medium transversally across the acoustical beam represented flow. First-order statistics were evaluated, and the signal-to-noise ratio from the signals were measured. The correlation coefficient method was used to present the results. Three velocity profiles were simulated: random spread of blood-flow velocity, linear blood-flow velocity gradient, and parabolic blood-flow. Radio frequency and envelope signals were used to calculate the decorrelation pattern. The results were compared to the mean decorrelation pattern for plug blood-flow. The RF signals decorrelation patterns were in good agreement with those obtained for plug blood flow. Envelope decorrelation patterns show a close agreement with the one for plug blood flow. For axial blood flow, there is a discrepancy between decorrelation patterns. The results presented here suggest that the decorrelation properties of an IVUS array catheter for measuring quantitative transverse blood flow probably will not be affected by different transverse blood-flow conditions.

## Abstract
Myxoid liposarcoma is the only translocation-associated liposarcoma subtype. It classically originates in the deep soft tissues of the thigh. At distal sites of the extremities, this tumor is exceedingly rare. We present a series of 8 cases occurring in the foot/ankle. Two female and 6 male patients, aged between 32 and 77 years (mean, 54.3 years), were identified. Tumor size ranged from 1.1 to 10 cm (mean, 6.8 cm). Two lesions eroded bone. All tumors were treated by excision and 7 by (neo)adjuvant radiotherapy. R0 status was reached in 2 cases with 1 case followed by metastasis in the groin. All other cases were documented with R1 (n=2) or R2 (n=4) resection status. In 1 patient, the follow-up status was unknown. All other patients were alive 15-135 (mean, 55.8) months after initial diagnosis. We conclude that myxoid liposarcoma at acral sites are exceedingly rare, and in this series, prognosis was good irrespective of resection status. Clinicians and pathologists have to be aware because this sarcoma type shows a peculiar clinical behavior with high radio- and chemosensitivity and metastatic spread to extrapulmonary sites.

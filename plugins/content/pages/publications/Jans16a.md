## Abstract
Creatine (Cr) supplementation to enhance muscle performance shows variable responses among individuals and different muscles. Direct monitoring of the supplied Cr in muscles would address these differences. In this feasibility study, we introduce in vivo 3D (13)C MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the leg with oral ingestion of (13)C4-creatine to observe simultaneously Cr and phosphocreatine (PCr) for assessing Cr uptake, turnover, and the ratio PCr over total Cr (TCr) in individual muscles. (13)C MRSI was performed of five muscles in the posterior thigh in seven subjects (two males and two females of ~20Â years, one 82-year-old male, and two neuromuscular patients) with a (1)H/(13)C coil in a 3T MR system before, during and after intake of 15Â % (13)C4-enriched Cr. Subjects ingested 20Â g Cr/day for 4Â days in four 5Â g doses at equal time intervals. The PCr/TCr did not vary significantly during supplementation and was similar for all subjects and investigated muscles (average 0.71Â Â±Â 0.07), except for the adductor magnus (0.64Â Â±Â 0.03). The average Cr turnover rate, assessed in male muscles, was 2.1Â Â±Â 0.7Â %/day. The linear uptake rates of Cr were variable between muscles, although not significantly different. This assessment was possible in all investigated muscles of young male volunteers, but less so in muscles of the other subjects due to lower signal-to-noise ratio. Improvements for future studies are discussed. In vivo (13)C MRSI after (13)C-Cr ingestion is demonstrated for longitudinal studies of Cr uptake, turnover, and PCr/TCr ratios of individual muscles in one exam.

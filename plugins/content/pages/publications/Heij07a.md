## Abstract
In a patient suspected of having recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy, we demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (1H-MRS) imaging of the prostate and a lymph node at 3 T using a matrix of external surface coils. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. With 1H-MRS imaging, high choline with low citrate signal was observed in the prostate, and in the lymph node a signal of choline-containing compounds was identified. The tissue level of the compounds in the enlarged lymph node was estimated to be 8.1 mmol/kg water. Subsequent histopathological analysis of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lymph node confirmed the presence of prostate cancer in both.

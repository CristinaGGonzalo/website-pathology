## Abstract
This study aims to provide more insight in attenuation characteristics and corresponding lead (Pb) equivalences of a broad range of commercially available lead composite and nonlead protective garments. Thirty garments of five manufacturers (listed as 0.25-0.35-0.50 mm Pb equivalent) were tested. Transmission values were determined at 70, 90 and 110 kVp using an inverse broad beam geometry. Pb equivalence was determined using lead sheets as reference material. A substantial variability in photon transmission across garments was found. Differences between lead composite and nonlead garments were not statistically significant. Depending on tube voltage, between 9 and 12 out of 30 garments had a lower Pb equivalence than the indicated value. This work shows that lead equivalence as indicated on a garment's label may overestimate its protective performance. Depending on the application a more thorough verification of the effectiveness of protective garments at the desired kVp is warranted.

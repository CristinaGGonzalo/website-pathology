## Abstract
Metastatic infection is a severe complication of bacteremia with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of F-FDG PET combined with CT (FDG PET/CT) in children suspected of having metastatic infection.The results of FDG PET/CT scans performed in children because of suspected metastatic infection from September 2003 to June 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The results were compared with the final clinical diagnosis.FDG PET/CT was performed in 13 children with suspected metastatic infection. Of the total number of FDG PET/CT scans, 38% were clinically helpful. Positive predictive value of FDG PET/CT was 71%, and negative predictive value was 100%.FDG PET/CT appears to be a valuable diagnostic technique in children with suspected metastatic infection. Prospective studies of FDG PET/CT as part of a structured diagnostic protocol are needed to assess the exact additional diagnostic value.

## Abstract
CramÃ©r-Rao theory can be used to derive the lower bound on the spatial resolution achievable with position-sensitive scintillation detectors as a function of the detector geometry and the pertinent physical properties of the scintillator, the photosensor and the readout electronics. Knowledge of the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) can for example be used to optimize the detector design and to test the performance of the method used to derive position information from the detector signals. Here, this approach is demonstrated for monolithic scintillator detectors for positron emission tomography. Two detector geometries are investigated: a 20 Ã— 10 Ã— 10 mm(3) and a 20 Ã— 10 Ã— 20 mm(3) monolithic LYSO:Ce(3+) crystal read out by one or two Hamamatsu S8550SPL avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, respectively. The results indicate that in these detectors the CRLB is primarily determined by the APD excess noise factor and the number of scintillation photons detected. Furthermore, it is shown that the use of a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for position estimation allows the experimentally obtained spatial resolution to closely approach the CRLB. The approach outlined in this work can in principle be applied to any scintillation detector in which position information is encoded in the distribution of the scintillation light over multiple photosensor elements.

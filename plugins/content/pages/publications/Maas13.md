## Abstract
To demonstrate that high quality T2 -weighted (T2w) turbo spin-echo (TSE) imaging of the complete prostate can be achieved routinely and within safety limits at 7 T, using an external transceive body array coil only.Nine healthy volunteers and 12 prostate cancer patients were scanned on a 7 T whole-body system. Preparation consisted of B0 and radiofrequency shimming and localized flip angle calibration. T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured and used to define the T2w-TSE protocol. T2w imaging was performed using a TSE sequence (pulse repetition time/echo time 3000-3640/71 ms) with prolonged excitation and refocusing pulses to reduce specific absorption rate.High quality T2w TSE imaging was performed in less than 2 min in all subjects. Tumors of patients with gold-standard tumor localization (MR-guided biopsy or prostatectomy) were well visualized on 7 T imaging (nâ€‰=â€‰3). The number of consecutive slices achievable within a 10-g averaged specific absorption rate limit of 10 W/kg was â‰¥28 in all subjects, sufficient for full prostate coverage with 3-mm slices in at least one direction.High quality T2w TSE prostate imaging can be performed routinely and within specific absorption rate limits at 7 T with an external transceive body array.

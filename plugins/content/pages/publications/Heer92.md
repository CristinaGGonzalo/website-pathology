## Abstract
Various aspects of the in vivo NMR spectroscopic approach to elucidate metabolic processes in humans are summarized. This includes the in vivo quantities that can be observed by this method, technical and methodological development (such as localization, spectral editing and quantitation) and the scope of current human in vivo NMR spectroscopy.

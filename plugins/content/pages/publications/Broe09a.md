## Abstract
The aim of the study was to determine whether patients' symptoms agree with findings on clinical examination and dynamic MR imaging of the pelvic floor.Symptoms of pelvic organ dysfunction were measured with the use of three validated questionnaires. The domain scores were compared with POP-Q and dynamic MR imaging measurements. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)) was used to assess agreement.Only the domain score genital prolapse was significantly correlated in the positive direction with the degree of pelvic organ prolapse as assessed by POP-Q and dynamic MR imaging (r(s) = 0.64 and 0.27, respectively), whereas the domain score urinary incontinence was inversely correlated (r(s) = -0.32 and -0.35, respectively).The sensation or visualization of a bulge in the vagina was the only symptom which correlated positively with the degree of pelvic organ prolapse, and clinical examination and dynamic MR imaging showed similar correlation in this respect.

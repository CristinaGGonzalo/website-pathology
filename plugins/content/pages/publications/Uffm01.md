## Abstract
With the advent of multislice technology computed tomography experienced a boost in image quality, comparable to the introduction of spiral CT one decade ago. In the chest, the improved performance may be utilised to scan faster or to obtain an almost isotropic spatial resolution. For examinations of the lungs multislice CT offers considerable advantages over single slice spiral CT: reduced breathing and pulsation artefacts, the ability to cover large volumes with thin slices, the simultaneous evaluation of high resolution and standard imaging protocols from one data acquisition, high resolution multiplanar sections through the lung parenchyma, and 3D techniques like volume rendering and virtual bronchoscopy. In this review the technical principles of multislice CT of the lungs are discussed. Major clinical applications such as evaluation of focal and diffuse lung disease are reviewed.

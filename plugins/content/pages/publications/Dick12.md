## Abstract
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is increasingly being used earlier in the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway in order to detect and localize disease. Its results can be used to help decide on the indication, type, and localization of a prostate biopsy for cancer diagnosis. In addition, mpMRI has the potential to contribute information on the characterization, or aggressiveness, of detected cancers including tumor progression over time. There is considerable variation in the way results of different MRI sequences are reported. We conducted a review of scoring systems that have been used in the detection and characterization of prostate cancer. This revealed that existing scoring and reporting systems differ in purpose, scale, and range. We evaluate these differences in this review. This first step in collating all methods of scoring and reporting mpMRI will ultimately lead to consensus approaches to develop a standardized reporting scheme that can be widely adopted and validated to ensure comparability of research outputs and optimal clinical practice.

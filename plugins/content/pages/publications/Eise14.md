## Abstract
The finding of subsolid pulmonary nodules poses a frequent problem in the daily routine of the radiologist. The biological behavior of such subsolid lesions differs significantly from solid nodules. The risk of malignancy is significantly higher in subsolid nodules as compared to solid or purely ground glass opacities or nodules. The recommendations regarding the diagnostic management of subsolid nodules have been adapted according to the tendency of growth and the risk of malignancy. A benign etiology is also seen quite often in subsolid lesions and in this case they will show a reduction of size or disappear completely by the follow-up examination. Therefore, in many cases a short-term follow-up examination is primarily recommended. As the findings will often show no changes for a long period of time, further annual follow-up examinations over a longer, not yet specified period of time are recommended. Subsolid lesions that grow in size and/or show an increase in density or develop a solid part within a ground glass lesion should remain as suspected malignancies until proven otherwise.

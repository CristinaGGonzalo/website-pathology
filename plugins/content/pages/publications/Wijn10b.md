## Abstract
To assess the reproducibility of (1)H-MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the human brain at 3T with volume selection by a double spin echo sequence for localization with adiabatic refocusing pulses (semi-LASER).Twenty volunteers in two different institutions were measured twice with the same pulse sequence at an echo time of 30 msec. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectra were analyzed with LCModel with a simulated basis set including an experimentally acquired macromolecular signal profile. For specific regions in the brain mean metabolite levels, within and between subject variance, and the coefficient of variation (CoV) were calculated (for taurine, glutamate, total N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, total choline, myo-inositol + glycine, and glutamate + glutamine).Repeated measurements showed no significant differences with a paired t-test and a high reproducibility (CoV ranging from 3%-30% throughout the selected volume). Mean metabolite levels and CoV obtained in similar regions in the brain did not differ significantly between two contributing institutions. The major source of differences between different measurements was identified to be the between-subject variations in the volunteers.We conclude that semi-LASER (1)H-MRSI at 3T is an adequate method to obtain quantitative and reproducible measures of metabolite levels over large parts of the brain, applicable across multiple centers.

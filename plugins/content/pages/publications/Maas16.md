## Abstract
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic vasculopathy that can lead to arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysms, and dissection. FMD of the renal arteries can lead to renovascular hypertension. Percutaneous angioplasty of the renal arteries (PTRA) can lead to normalization of blood pressure in 45% of patients with renal artery stenosis caused by FMD, particularly in younger patients and patients with a short history of hypertension. A considerable number of the patients with renovascular FMD also have cervical FMD, which can lead to ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. In this article we discuss diagnostic and therapeutic options, illustrated by two cases of patients with renovascular and carotid FMD. Most of the recommendations are based on data from retrospective studies and expert opinion; prospective studies on the optimal diagnostic strategy and treatment are therefore, urgently required.

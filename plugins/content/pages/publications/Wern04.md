## Abstract
A 4-year-old boy was hit by a car travelling at 40 km/h and was admitted 3.5 h later to the department of paediatric surgery. Because he was haemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion, the patient underwent an emergency operation. The liver was ruptured in the right lobe. A large haematoma was found in the serosa of the duodenum, along with a Meckel's diverticle, which was left in place. The liver rupture was covered and sealed. One month after the accident the patient was re-admitted, because of abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. The cause was thought to be the Meckel's diverticle, which was removed later. Two months after the trauma the patient was re-admitted with abdominal pain, again with haematemesis and melaena. The diagnosis of hemobilia was obtained with MRI and angiography, which revealed a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the ramus dexter of the proper hepatic artery. The patient was successfully treated with embolization. The diagnostic delay was two months, which illustrates the importance of considering the possibility of the diagnosis hemobilia in case of gastrointestinal haemorrhage combined with biliary symptoms.

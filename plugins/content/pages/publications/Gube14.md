## Abstract
<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To objectively evaluate automatic volumetric breast density assessment in Full-Field Digital Mammograms (FFDM) using measurements obtained from breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>A commercially available method for volumetric breast density estimation on FFDM is evaluated by comparing volume estimates obtained from 186 FFDM exams including mediolateral oblique (MLO) and cranial-caudal (CC) views to objective reference standard measurements obtained from MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Volumetric measurements obtained from FFDM show high correlation with MRI data. Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients of 0.93, 0.97 and 0.85 were obtained for volumetric breast density, breast volume and fibroglandular tissue volume, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Accurate volumetric breast density assessment is feasible in Full-Field Digital Mammograms and has potential to be used in objective breast cancer risk models and personalized screening.</p></sec>

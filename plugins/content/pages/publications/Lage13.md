## Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging is attracting increasing attention from the uroradiological community as a modality to guide the management of prostate cancer. With the high incidence of prostate cancer it might come as a surprise that for a very long time (and in many places even at present) treatment decisions were being made without the use of detailed anatomical and functional imaging of the prostate gland at hand. Although T2 -weighted MRI can provide great anatomical detail, by itself it is not specific enough to discriminate cancer from benign disease, so other functional MRI techniques have been explored to aid in detection, localization, staging and risk assessment of prostate cancer. With the current evolution of clinical MR systems from 1.5 to 3 T it is important to understand the advantages and the challenges of the higher magnetic field strength for the different functional MR techniques most used in the prostate: T2 -weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, MR spectroscopic imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. In addition to this, the use of the endorectal coil at different field strengths is discussed in this review, together with an outlook of the possibilities of ultra-high-field MR for the prostate.

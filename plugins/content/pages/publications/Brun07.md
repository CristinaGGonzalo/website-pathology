## Abstract
DBS for Parkinson's disease involves an extensive planning to find a suitable electrode implantation path to the selected target. We have investigated the feasibility of improving the conventional planning with an automatic calculation of possible paths in 3D. This requires the segmentation of anatomical structures. Subsequently, the paths are calculated and visualized. After selection of a suitable path, the settings for the stereotactic frame are determined. A qualitative evaluation has shown that automatic avoidance of critical structures is feasible. The participating neurosurgeons estimate the time gain to be around 30 minutes.

## W.M. Klein

## Abstract
The aim of this thesis was twofold. In the first place, we described two new diagnostic methods for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Secondly, the long-term follow-up of two treatment strategies for PAD (primary stent placement and angioplasty with selective stent placement) were investigated.

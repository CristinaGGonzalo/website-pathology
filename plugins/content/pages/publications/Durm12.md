## Abstract
Several epidemiologic studies have suggested an association of maternal smoking during pregnancy with an increased risk of childhood overweight or obesity. These studies used body mass index as outcome measure. Not much is known about the associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy with more specific measures of body fat and body fat distribution. The aim of the present study is to assess the associations of active maternal smoking during pregnancy and cigarette dose with body mass index and measures of general and abdominal adiposity in children at the age of 6 years. This study is embedded in the Generation R study, a population-based prospective cohort study from early fetal life until adulthood. Information on maternal smoking status was collected by questionnaires sent during pregnancy. Body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated. Information on general adiposity was obtained by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and abdominal adiposity by ultrasound. Results will be presented during the congress.

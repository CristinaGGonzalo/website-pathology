## Abstract
To show that CT of the petrous bone can be realized using a low-dose technique.and methods: A high-contrast phantom was scanned with 1.5 mm slice thickness and 60-510 mAs using the reconstruction algorithms standard, bone and edge. In 50 patients, the petrous bone was examined using the standard protocol at 510 mAS. Additionally, selected slices were made at 120 or 210 mAs. The resolution of relevant structures was compared. Phantom studies were repeated on a second CT-device; images of patients scanned with 80 mAs were analyzed in regard to resolution of osseous details.With the first CT-device structures of the phantom up to 0. 5 mm were depicted using 510 mAs and the edge kernel. With 120 mAs and the bone kernel structures of 0.6 mm could be distinguished. Although the same resolution was achieved with 60 mAs and the edge kernel, patient examinations showed a profound image noise. The results achieved with 120 mAs and the bone algorithm, however, were equal to that of 510 mAs. With the second device the same image quality was realized with only 80 mAs.CT-examinations of the petrous bone can be effected without loss of diagnostic information using only 15% of the radiation dose used for a standard brain examination.

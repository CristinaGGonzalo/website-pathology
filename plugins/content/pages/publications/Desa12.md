## Abstract
Objective: To assess the early vascular effects of sunitinib in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and T2* perfusion MRI. Patients and methods: In 10 patients with abdominal RCC lesions, DWI, DCE-MRI and T2* perfusion MRI measurements at 3 Tesla were performed at baseline, 3 and 10 days after start of sunitinib. VEGF-A plasma levels were measured on days 0, 3 and 10. Results: DWI showed a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ï¿½10-6 s/mm2) from baseline (mean 1158, range 814-2003) to day 3 (mean 1306, range 1008-2097, P = 0.015) followed by a decrease to baseline levels at day 10 (mean 1132, range 719-2005, P = 0.001). No significant changes were found in mean DCE-MRI parameters. T2* perfusion MRI showed a significant decrease in relative tumor blood volume (rBV) and relative tumor blood flow (rBF) at day 3 (rBV P = 0.037, rBF P = 0.018) and day 10 (rBV P = 0.006, rBF P = 0.009). VEGF-A plasma levels significantly increased after 10 days, but did not correlate with MRI parameters. Conclusions: Sunitinib induces antiangiogenic effects as measured by DWI and T2*-perfusion MRI, 3 and 10 days after the start of the initial treatment. DCE-MRI did not show significant changes. In the near future, early functional MRI-based evaluation can play an important role in tailoring treatment to the individual patient with RCC. Further investigation is warranted.

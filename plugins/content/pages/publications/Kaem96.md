## Abstract
We report findings in spiral-CT from 11 adolescent or adult patients after atrial switch operation. The results demonstrate that computed tomography, particularly with the use of three-dimensional surface reconstruction, is very useful as a highly sensitive procedure for the detailed depiction of residua and sequelae after inflow correction for complete transposition. Especially systemic venous obstruction (SVO) is a well know complication following Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries. Demonstration of such obstruction is important, since the recognition and quantification of caval obstruction by clinical techniques is unreliable and indeed often impossible. Imaging procedures such as spiral computed tomography are important for this purpose. Advantages of spiral computed tomography, particularly with three-dimensional reconstruction, are discussed. The images were compared with findings in echocardiography and/or angiography affecting the site of operation.

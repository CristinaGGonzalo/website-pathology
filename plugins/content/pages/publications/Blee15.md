## Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is often complicated by metastatic infectious foci. Some of these metastatic foci do not cause any localizing symptoms, which complicates early detection and adequate treatment. Where localizing symptoms are absent FDG-PET/CT is highly useful as a screening method for the identification of metastatic foci as it provides whole-body coverage. Furthermore, it detects early metabolic activity rather than the late anatomical changes needed for detection with CT or MRI. FDG-PET/CT has proven its clinical value and cost-effectiveness in diagnosing metastatic infections in patients with Gram positive bacteraemia, including S. aureus. Therefore, we firmly believe that all patients with a community-acquired S. aureus bacteraemia infection, with a time span longer than 48 h between the first symptoms and initiation of antibiotic therapy, fever that still persists after 72 h, or positive follow-up blood cultures at 48 h after the start of treatment would benefit from an FDG-PET/CT scan for timely detection of metastatic infection and optimal treatment.

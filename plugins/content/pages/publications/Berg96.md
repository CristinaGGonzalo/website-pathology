## Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine muscle glycogen recovery with glucose feeding (GF) compared with fructose feeding (FF) during the first 8 h after partial glycogen depletion using 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a clinical 1.5-TNMR system. After measurement of the glycogen concentration of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle in seven male subjects, glycogen stores of the VL were depleted by bicycle exercise. During 8 h after completion of exercise, subjects were orally given either GF or FF while the glycogen content of the VL was monitored by 13C-NMR spectroscopy every second hour. The muscular glycogen concentration was expressed as percentage of the glycogen concentration measured before exercise. The glycogen recovery rate during GF (4.2 +/- 0.2%/h) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with values during FF (2.2 +/- 0.3%/h). This study shows that 1) muscle glycogen levels are perceptible by 13 C-NMR spectroscopy at 1.5 T and 2) the glycogen restoration rate is higher after GF compared with after FF.

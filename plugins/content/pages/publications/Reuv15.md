## Abstract
Trastuzumab is successfully used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Because of its association with cardiotoxicity, LVEF is monitored by MUGA, though this is a relatively late measure of cardiac function. Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is believed to be an early predictor of cardiac impairment. We evaluate the merit of MUGA-derived diastolic function parameters in the early detection of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC).77 trastuzumab-treated patients with normal baseline systolic and diastolic function were retrospectively selected (n = 77). All serial MUGA examinations were re-analyzed for systolic and diastolic function parameters. 36 patients (47%) developed SD and 45 patients (58%) DD during treatment. Both systolic and diastolic parameters significantly decreased. Of the patients with SD, 24 (67%) also developed DD. DD developed prior to systolic impairment in 54% of cases, in 42% vice versa, while time to occurrence did not differ significantly (P = .52). This also applied to the subgroup of advanced stage breast cancer patients (P = .1).Trastzumab-induced SD and DD can be detected by MUGA. An impairment of MUGA-derived diastolic parameters does not occur prior to SD and therefore cannot be used as earlier predictors of TIC.

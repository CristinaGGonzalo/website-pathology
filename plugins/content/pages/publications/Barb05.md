## Abstract
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the primary curative option for refractory/relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although post-transplantation relapse remains a frequent cause of transplantation failure, the mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. In this study, we compared allogeneic T cell stimulation induced by sequentially obtained precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples from a single patient with overt graft versus leukemia (GVL) activity. We observed a loss of T cell stimulatory capacity by post-transplantation relapse samples and changes in expression of MHC and the costimulatory molecule CD137 ligand. This study suggests that escape from immune mechanisms after withdrawal of immune suppression is important to ALL progression.

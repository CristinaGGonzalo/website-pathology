## Abstract
In this paper, a fully automatic method for luminal contour segmentation in intracoronary ultrasound imaging is introduced. Its principle is based on a contour with a priori properties that evolves according to the statistics of the ultrasound texture brightness, which is generally Rayleigh distributed. The main interest of the technique is its fully automatic character. This is insured by an initial contour that is not set by the user, like in classical snake-based algorithms, but estimated and, thus, adapted to each image. Its estimation combines two pieces of information extracted from the a posteriori probability function of the contour position: the function maximum location (or maximum a posteriori estimator) and the first zero-crossing of its derivative. Then, starting from the initial contour, a region of interest is automatically selected and the process iterated until the contour evolution can be ignored. In vivo coronary images from 15 patients, acquired with the 20-MHz central frequency Jomed Invision ultrasound scanner, were segmented with the developed method. Automatic contours were compared to those manually drawn by two physicians in terms of mean absolute difference. The results demonstrate that the error between automatic contours and the average of manual ones is of small amplitude, and only very slightly higher (0.099 +/- 0.032 mm) than the interexpert error (0.097 +/- 0.027 mm).

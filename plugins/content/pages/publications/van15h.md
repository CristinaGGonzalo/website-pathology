## Abstract
Molecular imaging of specific biomarkers can have prognostic, predictive or monitoring value in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in various radiation resistance mechanisms as it steers the pathways related to DNA damage repair, proliferation, hypoxia and apoptosis. Radiolabeled labeled F(ab')2 fragments of the EGFR antibody cetuximab can be applied for non-invasive imaging of this receptor. Preclinical studies have shown that radioresistant tumors had a higher tracer uptake after irradiation, probably due to upregulation of membranous EGFR, thereby increasing target availability possibly as a compensation mechanism. Tumors with increased EGFR availability were also more responsive to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab. Potentially, radionuclide imaging of the EGFR can be applied for monitoring treatment regimens in clinical practice.

## Abstract
Although cardiac complications are some of the most serious complications of HSCT for leukemia, it is difficult to predict them. QTD has been reported as a predictor of heart failure and fatal arrhythmia in adults. The purpose of this study is to examine whether QTD predicts cardiac complications in pediatric HSCT. Eighteen patients (mean age, 6.9 yr; 11 ALL and seven AML) underwent high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment and total body irradiation as preparative conditioning for HSCT. QTD, QTcD, echocardiographic functional parameters, and cumulative anthracycline dose were evaluated. We compared these values between patients with and without cardiac complications. Among 18 patients, seven patients experienced cardiac complications (heart failure in four, arrhythmia in three). There were significant differences in QTD (43.7 ms in patients with cardiac complications vs. 30.2 ms in patients without the complications, p = 0.019) and QTcD (55.3 vs. 36.9 ms, p = 0.003) between the two groups. On the other hand, the cumulative dose of anthracycline and echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Increases in QTD and QTcD during the pretreatment period may be risk factors for the development of cardiac complications during and after conditioning for pediatric HSCT.

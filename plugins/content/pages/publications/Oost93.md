## Abstract
Quantitative acoustic parameters and image texture parameters were used in a linear discriminant analysis. This analysis was applied to detect retrospectively the classes of diffuse liver disease against a population of normal livers. Three different sets of parameters were employed. The first set was selected by the authors, and the other two were taken from the literature. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) (or percentage correct classification) obtained with the first set ranged from 88% to 97%, depending on the disease class. It is concluded that the first-order statistical parameters of the image texture (diffuse scattering model) together with the slope of the attenuation coefficient are the most important parameters. As an alternative to the texture parameters, the backscattering parameters (second set of parameters) also yielded a comparably high score. The texture analysis involving structural scattering (third set of parameters) produced a lower percentage of correct classification. The overall conclusion is that the methods devised might be used for prospective diagnosis.

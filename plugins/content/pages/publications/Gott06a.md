## Abstract
Radiolabelled peptides are used for specific targeting of receptors (over-)expressed by tumour cells. Dependent on the kind of labelling and the radionuclide used, these compounds may be utilised for imaging or for therapy. A concise overview is provided on basic principles of designing and developing radiopeptides for these applications. Furthermore, clinical application of these compounds for imaging and therapy is described. Advantages of the method compared to other techniques (such as the use of radiolabelled antibodies or antibody fragments) are discussed as well as pitfalls and limitations.

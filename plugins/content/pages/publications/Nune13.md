## Abstract
PURPOSE: After a glucose load, futile glucose/glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) cycling (FGC) generates [2-(2) H]glucose from (2) H2 O thereby mimicking a paradoxical glycogenolytic contribution to plasma glucose levels. Contributions of load and G6P derived from gluconeogenesis, FGC, and glycogenolysis to plasma glucose levels need resolution. A simple methodology is proposed integrating the administration of (2) H2 O with a glucose load containing [1-(2) H, 1-(13) C]glucose and [2-(2) H, 2-(13) C]glucose. METHODS: Mice fasted for 6 (nâ€‰=â€‰7) or 24 h (nâ€‰=â€‰5) were intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg/g 10% enriched glucose in 35 ÂµL/g (2) H2 O. Plasma glucose enrichment was analyzed by (2) H NMR after 30 min. RESULTS: For 6-h fasted mice, 12.3â€‰Â±â€‰1.5% of plasma glucose was pre-existing, 44.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.7% was load derived, and 43.4â€‰Â±â€‰1.8% G6P derived. G6P origins were 26.0â€‰Â±â€‰2.0% gluconeogenesis, 10.9â€‰Â±â€‰2.6% FGC, and 6.5â€‰Â±â€‰3.4% glycogenolysis. For 24-h fasted mice, 18.2â€‰Â±â€‰8.5% was pre-existing, 41.1â€‰Â±â€‰5.0 % was load derived, and 40.8â€‰Â±â€‰4.3% G6P derived. G6P origins were 27.1â€‰Â±â€‰3.3% gluconeogenesis, 13.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.8% FGC, and 0.6â€‰Â±â€‰2.4% glycogenolysis. CONCLUSION: After a glucose load, glycogenolytic contribution to plasma glucose was negligible, whereas FGC was significant for both 6- and 24-h fasted mice. Magn Reson Med, 2013.

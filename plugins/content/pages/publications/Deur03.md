## Abstract
Currently, breast cancer patients without clinically suspicious lymph nodes are candidates for sentinel lymph node procedures (SLNPs). The aims of this study were to investigate whether preoperative axillary ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) can reduce the number of the more time-consuming SLNPs, and to identify a subset of quantitative nodal features to predict metastatic involvement. 268 axillae were ultrasonographically examined. FNA was performed on suspicious nodes (smallest diameter > or =5 mm or atypical cortex appearance). SLNP was omitted if a tumour-positive node was found on FNA. Length, width, maximum cortex thickness and appearance of cortex and hilus were ultrasonographically established. In 93 axillae (35%), at least one node was detected with ultrasound. FNA was performed once per axilla on 66 nodes; 37 (56%) contained tumour cells. 31% of all tumour-positive axillae (macro-+micrometastases) was found by ultrasound and FNA (37/121). 41% of all axillae containing macrometastases was found by ultrasound and FNA (36/87). SLNPs were reduced by 14% (37/268). Maximum cortex thickness is the main feature to predict metastatic involvement (area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (A(Z))=0.87).

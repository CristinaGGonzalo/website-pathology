## Abstract
A patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia developed drug-induced pulmonary toxicity after using low dose oral etoposide. Because etoposide-induced pulmonary toxicity is an uncommon but serious adverse event, clinicians must be vigilant about the possibility of it, so that the optimal treatment can start as soon as possible. This report demonstrates that PET scintigraphy might be a helpful tool in the early diagnosis of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity.

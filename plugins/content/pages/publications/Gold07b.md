## Abstract
This article reviews recent preclinical and clinical advances in the use of pretargeting methods for the radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy of cancer. Whereas directly-labeled antibodies, fragments, and subfragments (minibodies and other constructs) have shown promise in both imaging and therapy applications over the past 25 years, their clinical adoption has not fulfilled the original expectations due to either poor image resolution and contrast in scanning or insufficient radiation doses delivered selectively to tumors for therapy. Pretargeting involves the separation of the localization of tumor with an anticancer antibody from the subsequent delivery of the imaging or therapeutic radionuclide. This has shown improvements in both imaging and therapy by overcoming the limitations of conventional, or 1-step, radioimmunodetection or radioimmunotherapy. We focus herein on the use of bispecific antibodies followed by radiolabeled peptide haptens as a new modality of selective delivery of radionuclides for the imaging and therapy of cancer. Our particular emphasis in pretargeting is the use of bispecific trimeric (3 Fab's) recombinant constructs made by a modular method of antibody and protein engineering of fusion molecules called Dock and Lock (DNL).

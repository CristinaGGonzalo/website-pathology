## Abstract
Speech is the most natural way of human communication. If the interaction between humans an machines is accomplished through voice, humans will feel more comfortable. Thus, this paper presents a Human/Robot Interface to teleoperate a robot by means of voice commands. To that purpose, an acoustic model in Spanish have been developed to recognize voice commands with Julius. The model is user dependent and has been suited to the proposed set of commands to achieve a better recognition rate. One of the advantages of the proposed speech recognition mechanism is that it can be easily adapted to a new list of commands. A robot has been successfully teleoperated with voice. Results about the recognition rate are promising in using the proposed Human/Robot Interface for voice teleoperation.

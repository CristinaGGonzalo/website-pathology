## Abstract
An increasing number of men will have to deal with suspected prostate cancer. For a definite diagnosis, a biopsy is required. Currently, a biopsy is performed under ultrasound guidance. The tumor is not visible on ultrasound, which may lead to misdiagnosis. The MRI is able to visualize the tumor, allowing a targeted biopsy. In this thesis, combining the advantages of both techniques is investigated, MRI guided ultrasound biopsies. Both the technical requirements, as well as the clinical feasibility have been investigated. The conclusion of this thesis is that MRI guided ultrasound biopsies can be successful for a subset of the tumors.

## Abstract
Radio frequency (RF) echograms were acquired from human subjects without liver pathology (n = 126), who were in the range of 20 to 84 years of age. After appropriate correction for the equipment settings and performance characteristics, acoustospectrographic parameters were estimated. The data were corrected for the frequency-dependent attenuation and then software demodulated. Image texture parameters were calculated based on the assumption of a particular tissue model, and purely statistical parameters were also estimated. The data thus obtained from each subject were corrected for the age trend that was assessed in an earlier publication by the authors. A total of 18 parameters was considered and the correlations were analyzed. It is concluded that nine parameters could be identified which did not strongly correlate with each other. This conclusion is supported by analysis of correlation data from patients. In a companion paper, a discriminant analysis is reported, based on the selected parameters (nine) and applied to the differentiation between normals and various classes of diffuse liver disease.

## Abstract
To evaluate the effect of ultrasonography (US) on the rate of appendectomy after false-positive diagnosis of acute appendicitis (negative appendectomy).Data were analyzed in 736 pediatric patients (mean age, 13.2 years) who had undergone appendectomy between 1995 and 2000. Histologic data were compared in patients who underwent US with those who did not undergo imaging prior to surgery. US was performed by a radiologist or a pediatric surgeon or both.A total of 643 (87.4%) of the 736 pediatric patients underwent preoperative US, and 93 (12.6%) of the 736 did not undergo preoperative US. Of the 736 patients, 97 (13.2%) underwent negative appendectomy. Thirty-four (36.6%) of the 93 patients who underwent appendectomy with no preoperative US and 63 (9.8%) of the 643 patients who underwent preoperative US underwent negative appendectomy. There was a significant association between US and positive appendectomy (P <.001).US in pediatric patients suspected of having appendicitis can significantly lower the negative appendectomy rate.

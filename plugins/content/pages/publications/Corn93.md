## Abstract
In vitro 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from perchloric acid extracts of human prostate tissue obtained by transurethral resection. This included tissue of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic adenocarcinoma; one tissue sample was obtained from a patient without any sign of BPH or malignancy. Major resonances in the magnetic resonance spectra were assigned to prostate compounds and were quantified. The citrate/lactate, citrate/total choline, phosphocholine/total creatinine, choline/total creatine, alanine/total creatine, phosphoethanolamine/total phosphate, phosphocholine/total phosphate and glycerophosphoethanolamine/total phosphate ratios were statistically different for the prostate cancer samples as compared with the BPH specimens. These observations may contribute to the understanding of in vivo magnetic resonance spectra of the prostate and indicate that magnetic resonance spectroscopy can aid in the diagnosis of prostate malignancy.

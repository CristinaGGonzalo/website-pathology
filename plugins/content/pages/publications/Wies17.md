title: Vascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease Therapeutic approaches in mouse models

## Maximilian Wiesmann

## Abstract
The elucidation of the underlying source of major vascular risk factors like hypertension, apoE4 and stroke during very early development of neurodegenerative processes in AD using several mice models was the first aim of this thesis. Hypertension has proven to be associated with cerebrovascular impairment already at young age in AD model mice leading to reductions in structural and functional connectivity accompanied by an impaired cognition.

## Abstract
Before liver transplant, it is necessary to know the size of the organ in advance of the procedure. We studied the correlation between liver volumetric computed tomography results and liver weight.Postmortem volumetric computed tomography was conducted on cadavers before autopsy, and 3-dimensional liver volume was estimated with semiautomated software. Liver weight was then determined at autopsy. Linear regression and univariate analysis of variance results were used to determine the accuracy of volumetric 3-dimensional computed tomography in estimating liver weight. We also used 2-dimensional liver sizes to design a 2-dimensional formula to estimate liver volume.We found that 3-dimensional volumetric computed tomography was able to accurately estimate liver weight (standard error = 157 g) with a liver density of 0.99 g/mL. Intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were small. The 2-dimensional formula estimated liver weight slightly less accurately (standard error = 212 g).We conclude that liver weight can be estimated accurately with 3-dimensional volumetric computed tomography; estimates were more precise than with the 2-dimensional formula-based liver volume estimation. Volumetric computed tomography can be an important tool during preoperative workup before transplant surgery.

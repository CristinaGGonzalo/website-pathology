## Abstract
The EANM Congress 2011 took place in Birmingham between the 15th and 19th October 2011 under the presidency of Professor Werner Langsteger. The attendance was reassuringly high, in line with other EANM congresses, despite the current 'Eurozone Crisis'. Participants from 87 countries came along, met old friends and made new ones. They were presented with a massive programme of 1,480 abstracts, symposia, and CME, scientific, plenary and featured sessions. The industry made a substantial contribution to the success of the congress with 109 hardware, software and radiopharmaceutical companies demonstrating the latest technology and innovations in the field. A feature in this year's congress was the emphasis on the role of the young generation. The highlight lecture was presented and this article was compiled by three young EANM members chosen from the young investigator project of the EANM. They review the most highly rated presentations in clinical and preclinical imaging in oncology, neuroendocrine tumours, cardiology, paediatrics and neurology, and provide an update on radionuclide therapy, physics, instrumentation, innovative tracers and techniques.

## Abstract
FDG-PET/CT has proven its clinical value and cost-effectiveness in diagnosing metastatic infections in patients with Gram-positive bacteremia. In identification of metastatic foci, FDG-PET/CT is useful as a screening method when localizing symptoms are absent because it provides whole-body coverage. FDG-PET/CT detects early metabolic activity rather than the late anatomical changes as visualized by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. FDG-PET/CT allows more precise localization of infection within a shorter time span between injection and diagnosis as compared to conventional nuclear imaging. This review focuses on the clinical application of imaging of metastatic infectious diseases, with an emphasis on FDG-PET/CT putting it in perspective with other imaging modalities.

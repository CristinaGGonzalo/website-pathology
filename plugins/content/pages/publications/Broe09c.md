## Abstract
INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This study evaluates the agreement in prolapse staging between clinical examination, dynamic magnetic resonance (MR), imaging and perineal ultrasonography. METHODS: Anatomical landmarks in the anterior, central, and posterior compartment were assessed in relation to three reference lines on dynamic MR imaging and one reference line on dynamic ultrasonography. These measurements were compared to the according POP-Q measurements. Agreement between the three methods was analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r (s)) and Bland and Altman plots. RESULTS: Correlations were good to moderate in the anterior compartment (r (s) range = 0.49; 0.70) and moderate to poor (r (s) range = -0.03; 0.49) in the central and posterior compartment. This finding was independent of the staging method and reference lines used. CONCLUSION: Pelvic organ prolapse staging with the use of POP-Q, dynamic MR imaging, and perineal ultrasonography only correlates in the anterior compartment.

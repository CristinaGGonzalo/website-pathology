## Abstract
â€ƒToll-like receptors (TLRs) play a central role in the innate immune response to complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs), with TLR10 being the first family member with known inhibitory function. This study assessed the role of TLR10 in recognition of cSSSI-related pathogens and whether genetic variation in TLR10 influences susceptibility to cSSSIs.â€ƒHuman PBMCs preincubated with anti-TLR10 antibody, and HEK-293 cells overexpressing TLRs were exposed to cSSSI pathogens and cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA. 318 patients with cSSSI and 328 healthy controls were genotyped for four non-synonymous SNPs in the TLR10 gene, and functional consequences of the TLR10 SNPs were assessed via in vitro stimulation assays.â€ƒPBMC stimulation with cSSSI pathogens in the presence of TLR10 neutralizing antibody significantly increased IL-6 secretion. Overexpression of TLR10 completely abrogated TLR2-induced IL-8 secretion of HEK-293 cells in response to cSSSI pathogens. Three polymorphisms in TLR10, I775L, I369L and N241H, were associated with reduced susceptibility to cSSSIs. Presence of TLR10 alleles 775L, 369L or 241H increased IL-6 secretion by PBMCs in response to cSSSI pathogens.â€ƒTLR10 is a modulatory receptor of innate immune responses to cSSSI-related pathogens, and genetic variants in TLR10 are associated with protection against cSSSIs.

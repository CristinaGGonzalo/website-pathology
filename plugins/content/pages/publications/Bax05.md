## Abstract
To assess the validity and the direct, short-term, and long-term reproducibility of renal blood flow (RBF) measurements with phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.In 20 healthy volunteers, RBF measurements were repeated with and without repositioning. Internal validity was assessed by comparing the total RBF with the difference in aortic flow above and below the renal arteries. In 19 healthy volunteers, RBF measurements were performed at two different occasions. In 40 healthy volunteers, RBF measurements were performed to assess normal values as a function of age. Analyses were performed according to Bland and Altman.The technical success rate ranged from 78% to 85%. Total RBF and the difference in aortic flow rates showed good agreement (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.72; P = .002). Directly repeated measurements had a mean difference of 54 mL/min in total RBF with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 17%. For repeated measurements with repositioning, the mean difference in total RBF was 74 mL/min (CV, 23%). Repeated measurements on different occasions showed a CV of 20%. The mean total RBF of the 40 healthy volunteers was 838 mL/min +/- 244 (SD).RBF measurement with PC MR has a success rate greater than 75%. The demonstrated internal reliability of this method and fair reproducibility of the flow parameters is crucial for further studies of the renal artery with MR imaging.

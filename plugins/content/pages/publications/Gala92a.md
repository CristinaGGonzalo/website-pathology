## Abstract
Chemoembolization is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, giving results equally as good as surgical therapy for T2 tumours. Survival can be prolonged and side-effects can be reduced by combining Lipiodol and Gelfoam for chemoembolization, employing a modified technique, with repeated procedures, and using appropriate follow-up treatment. The toxicity of the procedure is acceptable, but it requires supportive therapy necessitating an intense interdisciplinary co-operation.

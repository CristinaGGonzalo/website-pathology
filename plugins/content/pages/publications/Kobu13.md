## Abstract
PURPOSE: A semi-LASER sequence was optimized for in vivo lactate detection in the prostate. METHODS: The ethical committee waived the need for informed consent to measure 17 patients with high grade prostate cancer on a 3T system. A semi-LASER sequence was used with an echo time of 144 ms and optimized interpulse timing for a spectral citrate shape with high signal intensity. An LCModel basis set was developed for fitting choline, creatine, spermine, citrate, and lactate and was used to fit all spectra in tumor-containing voxels. For patients without detectable lactate, the minimal detectable lactate concentration was determined by adding in all spectra of tumor tissue a simulated lactate signal. The amplitude of the simulated lactate signal was iteratively decreased until its fit reached a CramÃ©r Rao lower bound >20%, which was then set as the patient-specific detection limit. RESULTS: In none of the patients a convincing lactate signal was found. We estimated that on average the lactate levels in high grade prostate cancer are below 1.5 mM (range 0.9-3.5 mM), Interestingly, in one patient with extensive necrosis in the tumor biopsy samples (Gleason score 5+5), large lipid resonances were observed, which originated from the tumor. CONCLUSION: The minimal detectable lactate concentration of 1.5 mM in high grade prostate cancer indicates that if lactate is increased it remains at low concentrations. Magn Reson Med, 2013.

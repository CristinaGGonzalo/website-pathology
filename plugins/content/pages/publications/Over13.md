## Abstract
In-bore magnetic resonance-guided biopsy (MRGB) has been increasingly used in clinical practice to detect prostate cancer (PCa). This review summarizes the current clinical results of this biopsy method. A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases. Of 2,035 identified records, 49 required full review. In all, ten unique studies reporting clinical results of MRGB could be included. Reported PCa detection rates ranged from 8 to 59 % (median 42 %). The majority of tumors detected by MRGB were clinically significant (81-93 %). Most frequent complications of MRGB are transient hematuria (1-24 %) and short-term perirectal bleeding (11-17 %). Major complications are rare. Based on the reviewed literature, MRGB can be regarded an accurate and safe diagnostic tool to detect clinically significant PCa. However, as general availability is limited, this procedure should be reserved for specific patients. Appropriate indications will have to be determined.

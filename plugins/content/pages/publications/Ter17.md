## Abstract
Implantation of pre-endothelialized stents could enhance cellular recovery of a damaged vessel wall provided attached cells remain viable, functional and are present in sufficient numbers after deployment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of grooved stainless steel (SS) stents as a primary endothelial cell (EC) carrier with potentially enhanced EC protection upon stent deployment. Attachment and behavior of enzymatically harvested human adult venous ECs seeded onto gelatin-coated vascular stents were evaluated in an in vitro setting. Smooth and grooved SS stents and smooth nitinol stents were studied. All cells expressed EC markers vWF and CD31. Using rotational seeding for a period of 16-24 h, ECs attached firmly to the stents with sufficient coverage to form a confluent EC monolayer. The grooved SS wire design was found to enable attachment of three times the number of cells compared to smooth wires. This also resulted in an increased number of cells remaining on the stent after deployment and after pulsatile flow of 180 ml/min for 24 h, which did not result in additional EC detachment. The grooved stent provides a potential percutaneous means to deliver sufficient numbers of viable and functional cells to a vessel segment during vascular intervention. The grooves were found to offer a favorable surface for EC attachment and protection during stent deployment in an in vitro setting.

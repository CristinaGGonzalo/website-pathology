## Abstract
To assess the safety and efficacy of dendritic cell vaccination in metastatic uveal melanoma.Interventional case series.We analyzed 14 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma treated with DENDRITIC CELL VACCINATION: Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma received at least 3 vaccinations with autologous dendritic cells, professional antigen-presenting cells, loaded with melanoma antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. The main outcome measures are safety, immunological response and overall survival.Tumor-specific immune responses were induced with dendritic cell vaccination in 4 out of 14 patients (29%). Dendritic cell vaccinated patients showed a median overall survival with metastatic disease of 19.2 months, relatively long compared to literature. No severe treatment-related toxicity (common toxicity criteria grade 3 or 4) were observed.Dendritic cell vaccination is feasible and safe in metastatic uveal MELANOMA: Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy is potent to enhance the host's antitumor immunity against uveal melanoma in about one third of patients. Compared to other prospective studies with similar inclusion criteria, dendritic cell vaccination may be associated with longer than average overall survival in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

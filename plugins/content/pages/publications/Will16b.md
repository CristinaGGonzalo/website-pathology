## Abstract
Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disease, caused by a deficiency in glucose homeostasis.The main characteristic of diabetes is chronically elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) which might occur due to auto-immune beta cell destruction (type 1 diabetes) or, when the beta cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance of the insulin responsive organs, such as the liver and skeletal muscles (type 2 diabetes). Although daily insulin injections and anti-diabetogenic drugs provide good glycemic control, all diabetic patients are at risk to develop severe micro- and macro-vascular complications.Nowadays, millions of people are suffering from diabetes and this number is expected to double within the next 15 years.

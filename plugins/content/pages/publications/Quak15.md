## Abstract
The value of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting viable tumours in patients with metastasised non-seminomatous testicular cancer and residual and new masses post chemotherapy remains to be determined. We describe the case of a 41-year-old patient with metastasised non-seminomatous testicular cancer, with both retroperitoneal and extra-retroperitoneal residual masses post chemotherapy, for whom FDG-PET/CT guided major treatment decisions. FDG-PET/CT correctly identified the locations of viable tumour, as was proved by histology, and successfully guided surgery. In conclusion, in selected cases surveillance of patients with non-seminomatous testicular cancer with FDG-PET/CT can guide major treatment decisions when considering surgery for metastatic disease.

## Abstract
A 72-year-old woman who recently had been treated with metronidazole presented with subacute dysarthria, gait ataxia and encephalopathy with severe anxiety. Head MRI showed symmetrical T2-hyperintensities. Under suspicion of a metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, metronidazole was stopped immediately. The patient recovered completely and follow-up MRI showed complete resolution of T2-hyperintensities.

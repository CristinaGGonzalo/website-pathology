## Abstract
It is unknown whether if a plain X-ray of the iliac arteries (pelvic X-ray) is a reliable tool to detect calcifications and predict vascular complications.In a prospective study, a pelvic X-ray was performed before transplantation in patients without evidence of peripheral vascular disease (n = 109) and vascular calcifications were scored. Vascular calcifications in the iliac arteries and complications were scored by the transplant surgeon during the operation (gold standard).Vascular calcifications were found on the pelvic X-ray in 33 patients (30.2%). The transplant surgeon identified vascular calcifications in 35%. Sensitivity and specificity of the pelvic X-ray for vascular calcifications in the iliac arteries were 48 and 82%, respectively. Technical problems with the arterial anastomosis due to vascular calcifications were observed in five patients. The negative predictive value and positive predictive value of a pelvic X-ray for complications with the arterial anastomosis were 99 and 14%, respectively.A pelvic X-ray is not a reliable tool to detect vascular calcifications. Technical problems with the arterial anastomosis due to calcifications are infrequent in the absence of vascular calcifications on the pelvic X-ray.

## Abstract
Twenty-three adult patients (19 females, 4 males) with x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HPR) underwent a retrospective evaluation of the clinical course and a clinical examination by a nephrologist, orthopedic surgeon and dentist. Blood and urine analysis, bone density measurements with QCT and DEXA, ultrasonic examination of the kidneys were performed and the patients were asked to fill in a standardized questionnaire on pain and psychosocial rehabilitation. Mean final height was 152.4 cm +/- 8.5 SD in females and 157.3 cm +/- 8.9 SD in males. Decreased joint mobility was seen in all patients, deviations of the normal leg axis in 18/23 patients in spite of 69 correcting osteotomies in the past. Dental (n = 14) and psychosocial problems were associated with inability to work (n = 8). There was a trend that patients with a very low Tp/GFR had a more severe course of the disease. Early therapy with vitamin D metabolites and phosphate had a beneficial effect on growth, bone density and deformations. Eight patients had nephrocalcinosis due to vitamin D and phosphate therapy and had normal kidney function. Four patients had urinary tract abnormalities. We conclude that patients with HPR should receive continuous interdisciplinary care given by nephrologists, orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists and dentists not only during childhood but also as adults.

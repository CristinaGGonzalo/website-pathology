## Abstract
Equinovarus foot deformity as seen in neurologic disease is often caused by imbalance in muscle tone. One of the possible operative procedures to correct this deformity is transposition of the posterior tibial tendon. The effect of this intervention is disputed in the orthopaedic literature. The results of this procedure are presented in a retrospective study of 9 children (11 feet). The mean follow-up period was 19 months (8-40). In all cases but one the results were satisfactory. The indications and complications of this operation are discussed.

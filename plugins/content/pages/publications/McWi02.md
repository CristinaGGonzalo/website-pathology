## Abstract
To report delayed pseudoaneurysm formation after percutaneous renal artery angioplasty.A 56-year-old woman succumbed to complications of a ruptured right juxtarenal aortic pseudoaneurysm 2 years after right renal artery stenting for renal impairment. The juxtarenal aorta had been normal on aortography at the time of angioplasty. She gave a history of right-sided back pain that started within 8 months of the angioplasty. A 21-year-old woman with left renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia was treated with balloon angioplasty, after which there was evidence of active extravasation. The completion angiogram, after a period of observation, documented cessation of the leak. Follow-up angiography because of persisting hypertension disclosed a large, asymptomatic, intrarenal pseudoaneurysm that was repaired with bench surgery and autotransplantation.We advise that patients with symptoms referable to the site of renal artery intervention and those who have had complicated interventions should have follow-up imaging to exclude pseudoaneurysm formation.

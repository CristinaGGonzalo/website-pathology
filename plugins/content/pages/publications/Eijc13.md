## Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term functional and motor development and abdominal muscle quantity in children operated on for giant omphalocele (GOC) with the Component Separation Technique (CST).Between 2004 and 2007, CST was applied in eleven consecutive infants with GOC. Eight underwent ultrasound of the abdominal wall and muscles, assessment of functional and motor development using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition (M-ABC-2), and an observational physical examination focused on possible abnormalities in stature and movements related to GOC. Findings were compared with those in age-matched controls. The parents filled in a questionnaire on the children's functioning in daily life.The mean age at evaluation was 71 months (range, 42-141 months) with a median time of follow-up of 54 months (range, 38-84 months). Ultrasound of the abdominal wall muscles showed normal muscle thickness. In seven of the eight children, a rectus diastasis was seen without any protrusion. The MABC-2 was within the normal range, and stature and motor coordination did not differ from those in controls.After 4.5 years, these children show normal thickness of all abdominal wall muscles and motor function within the normal range, despite a rectus diastasis. The CST seems to be a promising closure technique for GOC.

## Abstract
Formerly preeclamptic women with low plasma volume are at increased risk of recurrent gestational hypertensive disease. We hypothesized that a 4-week cycling training in formerly preeclamptic women improves (venous) hemodynamic function.In 9 formerly preeclamptic women, we examined physical fitness and hemodynamic function, before and after the training. We assessed blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, plasma volume, and calf and forearm venous compliance.After the training, baseline blood pressure and cardiac output remained unchanged, but resting heart rate decreased (-7%, P = .02). Plasma volume was 8% higher after training (P = .01). Calf venous compliance increased (+18%, P = .02) but not forearm venous compliance (+14%, P = .09).Cycling training improves venous vascular function in formerly preeclamptic women. The decreased resting heart rate and improvement of venous compliance suggest reduced sympathetic activity. These rapid exercise-induced changes may improve maternal vascular adaptation in early pregnancy and with it the risk of (recurrent) gestational hypertensive disease.

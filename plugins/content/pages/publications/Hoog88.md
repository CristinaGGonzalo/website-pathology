## Abstract
A double immunogold-labeling method in immunoelectron microscopy was used for simultaneous detection of two antigens by monoclonal antibodies [OKT 8 (CD 8), anti-Leu-7, anti-Leu-11b (CD 16)] on lymphocytes in suspension. The combination of gold probe size (5 nm and 15 nm) and monoclonal antibody was found to be decisive for detecting double-labeled cells with the OKT 8+, Leu-11b+ phenotype. The combinations of OKT 8 labeled with the 5-nm gold probe (OKT 8(5] and anti-Leu-11b with the 15-nm gold probe (Leu-11b15) gave double-labeled cells; the reverse situation, using OKT 8 with a 15-nm gold probe (OKT 8(15] and anti-Leu-11b with a 5-nm gold probe (Leu-11b5), did not. Double-labeled OKT 8+, Leu-7+ cells were detected irrespective of which gold probe combination was applied. Our findings indicate that although the double immunogold-labeling method is well suited for study of lymphocyte subsets, it is important to determine suitable combinations of gold probe sizes and monoclonal antibodies for the lymphocyte subset under study, taking into account surface antigen density, so that double labeling ensues.

## Abstract
The injection of 1.0 M glutamate into the masseter (jaw-closer) muscle results in a short period of muscle pain (5-10 min) and a prolonged period of mechanical sensitization (> 30 min). It is unclear, however, whether there is a temporal relationship between intramuscular glutamate concentration and either muscle pain or mechanical sensitization. In the present study, (1)H MRS and electrophysiological recording of masticatory muscle nerve fibers were performed in order to monitor glutamate clearance and nerve fiber activity, respectively, after injection of glutamate into rat masticatory muscles. Glutamate signal amplitude was found to decay rapidly (half-life t 1/2 = 108 +/- 42 s), and became indistinguishable from the baseline 10 min after the injection. Glutamate-evoked nerve fiber activity was also found to decay rapidly (t 1/2 = 76 +/- 28 s). These results suggest that glutamate clearance correlates well with the time course of glutamate-evoked muscle pain fiber discharge.

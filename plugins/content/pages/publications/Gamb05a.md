## Abstract
In clinical MR spectroscopy, double spin-echo point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequences are routinely used for volume selection. For strongly coupled AB spin systems under PRESS excitation, the dependence of the signal on the echo time TE has been thoroughly investigated, whereas less attention has been paid to the signal modulation which occurs at constant TE with varying interpulse delays. A substantial TE-independent J modulation is here predicted from analytical solutions of the Liouville equation and density matrix simulations, and verified with experiments on citrate at 1.5 and 3T. It is also shown that this modulation effect could be exploited for editing of strongly coupled AB resonances or for removal of singlets in spectra-by means of difference spectroscopy-just using a standard PRESS sequence. The applicability in vivo of this new spectral editing approach is also demonstrated, with selective detection of citrate resonances in the human prostate. This novel approach has the advantages of being simple, and directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners, provided that the exact behavior of the resonance is known.

## Abstract
Combination therapy with the biologically active (1-38) human parathyroid hormone peptide and calcitonin using pulsatile and sequential activation of the skeleton for 14 months in patients with low-turnover osteoporosis resulted in an increase in trabecular bone mass. These favorable responses were observed without any significant changes in cortical (forearm) bone mass content.

## Abstract
A novel method for quantitative evaluation of registration systems in thoracic CT is utilised to examine the effects of varying system parameters on registration error. Regional analysis is implemented to determine whether registration error is more prevalent in particular areas of the lungs. Experiments on twenty-four CT scan-pairs prove that in many cases significant reductions in processing time can be achieved without much loss of registration accuracy. More difficult cases require additional steps in order to achieve maximum precision. Larger errors appear more frequently in the lower regions of the lungs close to the diaphragm.

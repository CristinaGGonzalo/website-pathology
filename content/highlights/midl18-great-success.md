A big thank you to everyone who attended <a href="https://midl.amsterdam/">MIDL 2018</a> and made this first edition to a great success! Among 61 posters was the one from Computational Pathology group member <a href="https://diagnijmegen.github.io/website-pathology/members/hans-pinckaers/">Hans Pinckaers</a> who presented his work on how to train a normal CNN with 8192x8192 input sizes and a single label on only one GPU.

## Abstract
A technique is described for measuring the local hardness of the vessel wall and atheroma using intravascular ultrasound. Strain images were constructed using the relative local displacements, which are estimated from the time shifts between gated echo signals acquired at two levels of intravascular pressure. Time shifts were estimated using one-dimensional correlation with bandlimited interpolation around the peak. Tissue-mimicking phantoms with typical morphology and hardness topology of some atherosclerotic vessels were constructed. Hard and soft regions could be distinguished on the strain image, independently of their contrast in echogenicity. Thus, the potential of ultrasonic hardness imaging to provide information that may be unavailable from the echogram alone was demonstrated. The strain images of the homogeneous and layered phantoms showed some artifacts that need to be corrected for, to obtain images of the modulus of elasticity. For in vitro and in vivo experiments, the spatial resolution of the technique needs to be improved. Furthermore, two-dimensional correlation techniques may be necessary in case of nonradial expansion and an off-centre catheter position.

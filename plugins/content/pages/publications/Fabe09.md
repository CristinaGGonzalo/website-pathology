## Abstract
To evaluate the effect of implant location and skin thickness on the frequency and degree of adverse skin reactions around the abutment.Retrospective multivariate analysis of implant position related to skin thickness and clinical variables.Tertiary referral center.Random sample of 248 patients with bone-anchored hearing aids.Bone-anchored hearing aid implant placement by means of the linear incision technique. MeanType and number of skin reactions and implant loss.The mean (SD) distance from the external auditory ear canal to implant was 48.8 (8.0) mm (range, 29-84 mm). The mean skin thickness was 5.5 (1.9) mm. Severe skin reactions (Holgers classification, 2-4) were seen in 46 of the 248 patients (18.5%). Implant loss occurred in 4 patients (1.6%). Three implants were lost owing to failed osseointegration (1.3%), and another implant was removed because of deterioration of cochlear function (0.9%). No implant was lost as a result of infection.Implant location and skin thickness were not correlated with implant loss or the frequency or degree of adverse skin reactions around the abutment.

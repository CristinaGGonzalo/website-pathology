## Abstract
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the prostate has been used with only a combination of external surface coils. The quality of spectral fitting of the (cholineâ€‰+â€‰creatine)/citrate ([Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr]/Cit) ratio at different field strengths and different coils is important for quantitative/semi-quantitative diagnosis of prostate cancer.To evaluate the quality of spectral fitting of the (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio of a prostate phantom using MRSI at different field strengths and various coils.Experiments were using 1.5-T and 3.0-T MR systems. Measurements were taken on a homemade prostate phantom with different coils: spinal array; abdominal array; and endorectal. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of choline, creatine, and citrate peaks as well as the (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio in each voxel were compared among groups using multi-way analysis of variance.Magnetic field strength, coils, and plane position had a significant effect on the SNR or (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio, and there were interactions among groups (all Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The 1.5-T (0.228â€‰Â±â€‰0.044) exhibited a higher (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio than the 3.0-T (0.125â€‰Â±â€‰0.041) magnetic field strength (Fâ€‰=â€‰3238, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio of both surface coils (0.183â€‰Â±â€‰0.065) and all coils (0.181â€‰Â±â€‰0.057) was significantly lower than that of the endorectal coil (0.195â€‰Â±â€‰0.077) (both Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), but significant differences in the mean (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratio were not observed if surface coils and all coils were used (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). No significant differences were found among the (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratios of all voxels in the middle planes by the post-hoc analyses (all Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05).Three-dimensional proton MRSI of prostate metabolites in a phantom using surface coils is feasible and reliable, but (Choâ€‰+â€‰Cr)/Cit ratios acquired at different magnetic fields and coils were different. This difference should be taken into account when calculating this ratio in a field strength-independent way.

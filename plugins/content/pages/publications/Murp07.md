## Abstract
The automated detection of lung nodules in CT scans is an important problem in computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper an approach to nodule candidate detection is presented which utilises the local image features of shape index and curvedness. False-positive candidates are removed by means of a two-step approach using kNN classification. The kNN classifiers are trained using features of the image intensity gradients and grey-values in addition to further measures of shape index and curvedness profiles in the candidate regions. The training set consisted of data from 698 scans while the independent test set comprised a further 142 images. At 84% sensitivity an average of 8.2 false-positive detections per scan were observed.

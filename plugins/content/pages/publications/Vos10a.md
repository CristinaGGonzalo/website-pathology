## Abstract
PURPOSE/AIM 1. Demonstrate our in-house developed clinical diagnostic workstation. 2. Present multi-parameter (T2-w, DWI, DCE-MRI and MRS) MRI data. 3. Demontrate prostate cancer interpretation with histopathologic correlation 4. Train the radiologist in using the CAD system. 5. Investigate the effect of CAD on the discriminative performance of the radiologist. CONTENT ORGANIZATION The workstation enables joint analysis of anatomic, functional, metabolic MR imaging, CAD and structured reporting. Training cases are presented to instruct the radiologist how to use the system, how to interpret MR images and provide correlation with whole-mount step-section histology tumor maps. The radiologist can diagnose a number of test cases and use CAD as a 2nd opinion. The discriminative performance of the radiologist is presented along with added value of CAD. SUMMARY The clinical value of Multi-Modal MR imaging for diagnosing prostate cancer is demonstrated to the radiologist. Certain imaging features (alone or in combination) MRI can help to differentiate prostate cancer from benign cases such as prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but requires experience. The potential benefit of using CAD as a 2nd opinion is demonstrated in a clinical workflow setting.

## Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for the preoperative assessment of mandibular invasion in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), adjacent or fixed to the mandible. DCE-MRI was performed with gadolinium diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Data were obtained from 25 patients. From pharmacokinetic analysis of the tissue uptake of Gd-DTPA, the DCE-MRI parameters (k(ep), K(trans) and v(e)) were determined, with k(ep) representing the exchange rate constant, K(trans) the volume transfer constant and v(e) the volume of extracellular space per unit volume of tissue. The histology of the resection specimens was used as gold standard for the extent of mandibular invasion. SCC with medullary invasion showed higher mean k(ep) and K(trans) compared with SCC without medullary invasion (ANOVA, p<0.001). ROC analysis of k(ep) and K(trans) revealed reliable threshold values for medullary invasion. In conclusion, DCE-MRI can discriminate SCC with medullary invasion from SCC without medullary invasion and may serve as a valuable tool in preoperative tumour staging with regard to the delineation of medullary invasion.

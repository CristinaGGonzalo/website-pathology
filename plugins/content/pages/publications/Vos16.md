## E. Vos

## Abstract
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an upcoming role in the management of prostate cancer, it serves as a non-invasive tool to acquire anatomic and functional information about the prostate. It has been shown that MRI can detect prostate cancer with a high sensitivity and specificity. In this thesis we try to take MRI a step further. The purpose of this thesis is twofold: the first part aims to evaluate functional MRI techniques for the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness; the second part aims to explore the possibilities of newly developed techniques for application in prostate cancer imaging.

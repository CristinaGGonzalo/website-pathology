## Abstract
Angio-Seal is a frequently used vascular closure device after arterial catheterisation. Major complications are infrequently reported. We present four cases occurring within a 2-month period in our hospital with dislodgement of an Angio-Seal causing acute arterial occlusion, resulting in loss of limb in one case. Surgical intervention was necessary in all cases. Acute arterial occlusion after deployment of the Angio-Seal in patients with peripheral arterial disease might be less uncommon than the literature suggests.

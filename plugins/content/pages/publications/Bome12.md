## Abstract
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate MRI-guided therapies and to investigate their feasibility for focal therapy in prostate cancer patients. Relevant articles were retrieved using the PubMed online search engine. CONCLUSION: Currently, MRI-guided laser ablation and MRI-guided focused ultrasound are the most promising options for focal treatment of the prostate in patients with prostate cancer. Other techniques-that is, cryosurgery, microwave ablation, and radiofrequency ablation-are, for several and different reasons, less suitable for MRI-guided focal therapy of the prostate.

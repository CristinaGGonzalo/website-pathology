## Abstract
Up to 20-30% of patients with metastatic non-medullary thyroid cancer have persistent or recurrent disease resulting from tumour dedifferentiation. Tumour redifferentiation to restore sensitivity to radioactive iodide (RAI) therapy is considered a promising strategy to overcome RAI resistance. Autophagy has emerged as an important mechanism in cancer dedifferentiation. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of autophagy activators for redifferentiation of thyroid cancer cell lines. Five autophagy activating compounds, all known as digitalis-like compounds, restored hNIS expression and iodide uptake in TC cell lines. Upregulation of hNIS was mediated by intracellular Ca2+ and FOS activation. Cell proliferation was inhibited by downregulating AKT1 and by induction of autophagy and p21-dependent cell cycle arrest. Digitalis-like compounds, also designated as cardiac glycosides for their well characterized beneficial effects in the treatment of heart disease, could therefore represent a promising repositioned treatment modality for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid carcinoma.

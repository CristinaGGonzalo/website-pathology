## Abstract
Cellular therapy, including stem cell transplants and dendritic cell vaccines, is typically monitored for dosage optimization, accurate delivery, and localization using noninvasive imaging, of which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key modality. (19)F MRI retains the advantages of MRI as an imaging modality, and also allows direct detection of labeled cells for unambiguous identification and quantification, unlike typical metal-based contrast agents. Recent developments in (19)F MRI-based in vivo cell quantification, the existing clinical use of (19)F compounds and current explosive interest in cellular therapeutics have brought (19)F imaging technology closer to clinical application. We review the application of (19)F MRI to cell tracking, discussing intracellular (19)F labels, cell labeling and in vivo quantification, as well as the potential clinical uses of (19)F MRI.

## Abstract
Management of patients with congenital heart disease requires detailed information on cardiac and great vessel morphology. In previous years, the diagnosis and the treatment of congenital malformations has often depended on cardiac catherization, and in many institutions, cardiac catherization still remains the gold standard against which other modalities are measured. In the past decade, however, imaging methodologies have increasingly shifted toward the use of less invasive and noninvasive techniques. Currently, echocardiography is the initial method of choice in evaluating the anatomy, especially in younger patients. Meanwhile, several newer imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spiral or multislice computed tomography (CT) are in use. They offer extremely useful information about abnormalities of the heart and great vessels as well as the assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. Echo, angiography, MRI and CT should be seen as complimentary investigations in adult congenital heart disease.

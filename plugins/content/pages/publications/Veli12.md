## Abstract
The recent increased interest in information fusion methods for solving complex problem, such as in image analysis, is motivated by the wish to better exploit the multitude of information, available from different sources, to enhance decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel method, that advances the state of the art of fusing image information from different views, based on a special class of probabilistic graphical models, called causal independence models. The strength of this method is its ability to systematically and naturally capture uncertain domain knowledge, while performing information fusion in a computationally efficient way. We examine the value of the method for mammographic analysis and demonstrate its advantages in terms of explicit knowledge representation and accuracy (increase of at least 6.3% and 5.2% of true positive detection rates at 5% and 10% false positive rates) in comparison with previous single-view and multi-view systems, and benchmark fusion methods such as naï¿½ve Bayes and logistic regression.

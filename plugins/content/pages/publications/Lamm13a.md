## Abstract
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the inter- and intraobserver reliability for diagnosing pubovisceral muscle avulsions and measurements of the levator hiatus on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Women with recurrent POP or in whom there was a discrepancy between clinical signs and symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction were potentially eligible to participate. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging datasets of the pelvic floor of 262 women were obtained and scored by two observers. A random sample of 100 patients was reviewed a second time by one of the observers. Intraclass correlation coefficient with 95% confidence interval (ICC 95%CI) of all measurements were calculated. Furthermore, mean differences with accompanying limits of agreement were calculated to estimate agreement between two measurements and to detect possible systematic biases. RESULTS: Good interobserver reliability for pubovisceral muscle avulsions was found (ICC 0.76 - 0.79) and excellent agreement for measurements of the levator hiatus (ICC 0.85 - 0.89). The intraobserver reliability for pubovisceral muscle avulsions and other levator hiatus measurements also showed to be excellent (ICC 0.80 - 0.97). A significant systematic bias was observed in the mean difference of levator hiatus transverse diameter when measured by both observers, however, narrow limits of agreement were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pubovisceral muscle avulsions and levator hiatus measurements can be assessed with good to excellent reliability.

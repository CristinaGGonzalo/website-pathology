## Abstract
Calcium Phosphate Cements (CPCs) are widely used bone substitutes. However, CPCs have similar radiopacity as natural bone, rendering them difficult to be differentiated in classical X-ray and CT imaging. As conventional MRI of bone is cumbersome, due to a low water content and very short T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time, ultra-short echo time (UTE) and zero echo time (ZTE) MRI have been explored for bone visualization. This study examined the possibility to differentiate bone and CPC by MRI. T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>* values determined with UTE MRI showed little difference between bone and CPC, hence these materials were difficult to separate based on T<sub>1</sub> or T<sub>2</sub> alone. Incorporation of ultra-small particles of iron oxide (USPIO) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) (1 wt% and 5 wt% respectively) into CPC resulted in visualization of CPC with decreased intensity on ZTE images in in-vitro and ex-vivo experiments. However, these additions had unfavorable effects on the solidification time and/or mechanical properties of the CPC, with the exception of 1% Gd-DTPA alone. Therefore we tested this material in an in vivo experiment. The contrast of CPC was enhanced at an early stage post-implantation, and was significantly reduced in the 8 weeks thereafter. This indicates that ZTE imaging with Gd-DTPA as a contrast agent could be a valid radiation free method to visualize CPC degradation and bone regeneration in preclinical experiments.

## Abstract
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous virus responsible for acute infections of the respiratory tract in patients of all ages. RSV presents significant health risks to immunocompromised patients. Two patients, 1 before a liver transplant and 1 after a liver transplant, died of a severe RSV infection. Because of the high risk of death, we recommend expanding the criteria for palivizumab prophylaxis to 2 types of patients: (1) patients with chronic liver disease or who have received a liver transplant and are 24 months old or less and (2) transplant recipients with underlying pulmonary conditions who are less than 36 months old. Further research is indicated in pediatric solid-organ transplant centers to evaluate the effective management of RSV infection to prevent morbidity.

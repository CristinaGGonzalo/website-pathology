## Abstract
Angiography is still the standard for imaging of vascular structures. However, since the number of projections is limited, complex pathoanatomy may not be sufficiently visible. This study presents two patients in whom 3D reconstruction from Spiral CT data revealed combined vascular lesions undisclosed by angiography. In one case the combination of coarctation and chronic dissection type B, in another the combination of two aneurysms of the celiac trunk in series was disclosed. We conclude that 3D reconstruction can be a valuable asset in the diagnosis of complex vascular pathoanatomy.

## Abstract
The data on echographic routine diagnosis of intraocular tumours (prominence equal to, or larger than 2 mm) during the years 1976-1990 in the authors' department, were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods, using the final diagnosis either from pathology after enucleation or from the confirmed clinical diagnosis. The material consisted of melanomas (n = 325), metastases (n = 44), haemangiomas (n = 19) and other intraocular tumours (n = 16). The best set of echographic parameters in descending order of significance was: reflectivity (A-mode), choroidal excavation (B-mode), shape (B-mode), and regularity (A/B mode). Echographic differentiation by computer analysis of data on the three main kinds of tumours (melanoma/metastasis/haemangioma) separate from all the remaining tumours was expressed by the correct fraction: melanoma 89%, metastasis 80% and haemangioma 97%. The clinical echographic classification for these cases was 89%, 93% and 99.5%, respectively. The simultaneous differentiation between the three classes was found to yield a correct fraction of 85% by computer statistics and 95% by routine echography. The results of the present study might be used for prospective classification through the use of the parameter 'knowledge base' contained in the statistical classification procedure.

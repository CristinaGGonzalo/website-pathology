## Abstract
Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) involves a method of complete vascular isolation of the liver to allow treatment of liver tumours with toxic systemic doses. The recent clinical studies mainly employed IHP with melphalan with or without tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and mild hyperthermia. The results of these studies show that high response rates and high survival rates can be achieved by IHP. In this article, the current status, recent developments and future perspectives of IHP are discussed.

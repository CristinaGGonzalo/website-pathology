## Abstract
In this article, we describe the fundamentals of multiparametric MRI in bladder cancer and provide an overview of the currently available data concerning this new imaging technology. Urinary bladder cancer is a relatively common malignancy, especially in elderly patients. Treatment outcome and prognosis are strongly related to adequate local and regional tumor staging. Unfortunately, clinical understaging frequently occurs, which negatively influences prognosis. Therefore, advanced imaging techniques are needed to adequately stage bladder cancer patients. MRI is currently the best imaging technique for local and nodal staging in bladder cancer patients because of its superior soft-tissue contrast without exposure to ionizing radiation. Important improvements in MRI technology have led to the introduction of multiparametric MRI, combining anatomic and functional sequences.The first results of multiparametric MRI seem promising, especially in detection, staging, and follow-up of bladder cancer. However, more studies are needed with larger study populations to define the exact place of multiparametric MRI in bladder cancer patients.

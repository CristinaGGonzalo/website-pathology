## Abstract
The ability of a human B-cell lymphoma cell line to grow subcutaneously as tumors in nude mice was investigated. The effect of pretreating mice with cyclophosphamide or whole-body irradiation (WBI) was compared with no pretreatment of the mice. Both methods of pretreatment resulted in a higher tumor implantation rate, compared with that for non-pretreated controls. In mice that underwent WBI-pretreatment, a tumor implantation rate of 100% was observed, whereas mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide had a tumor implantation rate of 80%. In non-pretreated control mice, an implantation rate of only 50% was observed. Three weeks after injection, tumor size was significantly larger in mice of the pretreated groups, compared with that in mice of the group that did not receive pretreatment. Furthermore, particularly in the group pretreated with WBI, the tumors grew more synchronously, compared with tumors in the control group. Results of this study indicate that pretreatment with cyclophosphamide or WBI improves the tumor implantation rate of Ramos cells in nude mice, providing a workable animal model for studying human B-cell lymphoma.

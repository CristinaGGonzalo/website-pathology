## Abstract
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in the Western male population and the associated socioeconomic impact on healthcare is of great concern. Since the early 1990s, MRI has evolved into an important diagnostic imaging modality for prostate cancer patients. In this review, the applications of diagnostic imaging modalities in prostate cancer, such as transrectal ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI are described. The clinical value of these techniques in prostate cancer detection, localization, characterization, staging and active surveillance are discussed.

## Abstract
The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to establish and evaluate novel MR methods to assess tumor perfusion, hypoxia and metabolism in preclinical models of cancer. These methods can be applied in the diagnosis of tumors, in the research to understand the physiology of tumors and to evaluate cancer therapy. This thesis focuses on clinically relevant tumor models of diffuse infiltrative glioma of human origin, growing in the mouse brain.

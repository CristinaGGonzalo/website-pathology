title: Advanced Multiple Beam Equalization Radiography

## Schultze Kool, L. J.

## Abstract
The main problem of thoraxdiagnosis is the difference in Roentgen absorption between the mediastinum and the lungs. This frequently causes under- or overexposed areas in thoracic images. The AMBER equalization system described in this thesis enables Roentgen dosage to be modulated within a single image, based on local absorption. As a result, image quality improves drastically.

## Abstract
A mammographic screening workstation has been developed in which CAD results for mass detection are presented fundamentally different than in current practice. Instead of displaying all CAD findings as prompts the reader can probe image regions for the presence of CAD information. The aim of the system is to help radiologists with decision making rather than avoiding oversight errors. In a preliminary observer study we studied the effect of using the interactive CAD system. Four non-radiologists and two radiologists participated. Each observer read 60 cases two times, once with and once without CAD. The set included 20 cases with subtle cancers that were missed at screening. It was found that performance of the readers increased significantly with interactive use of CAD.

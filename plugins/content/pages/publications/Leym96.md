## Abstract
REALISE was designed to extract from sequences of images, acquired with a moving camera, the information necessary for determining the 3D (CAD-like) structure of a real-life scene together with information about the radiometric signatures of surfaces bounding the extracted 3D objects (e.g. reflectance behaviour). The retrieved information is then integrated in a virtual reality (VR) software environment. The R amp;D work is been performed principally in the following areas of computer vision and computer graphics: structure from motion, recovery of geometries, recovery of photometric and texture information, highly realistic rendering on the basis of empirically-based reflectance models, and the design and development of improved rendering processes together with a new VR system. Beside this innovative R&D work another key aspect of REALISE is to have computer vision and computer graphics cooperate to produce realistic 3D data efficiently

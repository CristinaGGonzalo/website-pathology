## Abstract
In vivo imaging using (19)F MRI is advantageous, due to its ability to quantify cell numbers, but is limited for a lack of suitable labels. Here, we formulate two stable and clinically applicable labels for tracking two populations of primary human dendritic cells (DCs) simultaneously.Plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs are able to take up sufficient nanoparticles (200 nm) for imaging (10(12 19)F's per cell), despite being relatively nonphagocytic.Clinically relevant numbers of labeled DCs could be imaged in about 10 min, even on a clinical scanner.We demonstrate the use of perfluorocarbon nanoparticles for simultaneous (19)F MRI of distinct cell populations in a clinical setting, without spectroscopic imaging.

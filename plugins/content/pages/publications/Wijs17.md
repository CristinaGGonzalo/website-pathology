## Abstract
Retrospective evaluation of 188 advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with IMRT or VMAT revealed a limited increase of moderate to severe acute esophageal toxicity after VMAT. Acute pulmonary toxicity and severe late toxicity were low. Overall survival did not differ between the IMRT and VMAT groups.

title: Effects of sera from patients with Hodgkin's disease and of cytokines on the expression of parallel tubular structures and cell surface antigens in lymphocytes

## Y. L. Hoogeveen

## Abstract
The key terms which form the basis of this thesis are Hodgkin's disease (HD), granular lymphocytes, parallel tubular structured (PTS), induction, serum factor(s), interferon-a (IFNa), immunoelectron microscopy (IEM), and natural killer (NK) activity. The main aims of the present investigation were to reveal the identity of the unknown factor responsible for the granular lymphocyte induction and NK activity enhancement, determine the subpopulations(s) to which the granular cells belong, and gain insight into the function of these cells in HD patients.

## Abstract
The CT angiography is the diagnostic method of choice in patients with aortic emergencies. It allows for reliable evaluation of aortic dissection, aortic rupture as well postoperative and post-interventional complications. It can be performed rapidly with the option of continuous monitoring of the patient. Transesophageal echocardiography is an alternative primary diagnostic method in patients with aortic dissections. MRI does not play a role due to the limited possibilities for patient monitoring. Only in patients with limited renal function MRI may be employed instead of CT as primary diagnostic modality.

## Abstract
To improve cancer detection in mammography, breast exams usually consist of two views per breast. To combine information from both views, radiologists and multiview computer-aided detection (CAD) systems need to match corresponding regions in the two views. In digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), finding corresponding regions in ipsilateral volumes may be a difficult and time-consuming task for radiologists, because many slices have to be inspected individually. In this study we developed a method to quickly estimate corresponding locations in ipsilateral tomosynthesis views by applying a mathematical transformation. First a compressed breast model is matched to the tomosynthesis view containing a point of interest. Then we decompress, rotate and compress again to estimate the location of the corresponding point in the ipsilateral view. In this study we use a simple elastically deformable sphere model to obtain an analytical solution for the transformation in a given DBT case. The model is matched to the volume by using automatic segmentation of the pectoral muscle, breast tissue and nipple. For validation we annotated 181 landmarks in both views and applied our method to each location. Results show a median 3D distance between the actual location and estimated location of 1.5 cm; a good starting point for a feature based local search method to link lesions for a multiview CAD system. Half of the estimated locations were at most 1 slice away from the actual location, making our method useful as a tool in mammographic workstations to interactively find corresponding locations in ipsilateral tomosynthesis views.

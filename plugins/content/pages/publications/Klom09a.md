## Abstract
The sensitivity of proton MR Spectroscopic Imaging ((1)H-MRSI) of the prostate can be optimized by using the high magnetic field strength of 7 T in combination with an endorectal coil. In the work described in this paper we introduce an endorectal transceiver at 7 T, validate its safety for in vivo use and apply a pulse sequence, optimized for three-dimensional (3D) (1)H-MRSI of the human prostate at 7 T. A transmit/receive endorectal RF coil was adapted from a commercially available 3 T endorectal receive-only coil and validated to remain within safety guidelines for radiofrequency (RF) power deposition using numerical models, MR thermometry of phantoms, and in vivo temperature measurements. The (1)H-MRSI pulse sequence used adiabatic slice selective refocusing pulses and frequency-selective water and lipid suppression to selectively obtain the relevant metabolite signals from the prostate. Quantum mechanical simulations were used to adjust the inter-pulse timing for optimal detection of the strongly coupled spin system of citrate resulting in an echo time of 56 ms. Using this endorectal transceiver and pulse sequence with slice selective adiabatic refocusing pulses, 3D (1)H-MRSI of the human prostate is feasible at 7 T with a repetition time of 2 s. The optimized inter-pulse timing enables the absorptive detection of resonances of spins from spermine and citrate in phase with creatine and choline. These potential tumor markers may improve the in vivo detection, localization, and assessment of prostate cancer.

## Abstract
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been shown to reduce the incidence of local recurrence of colorectal cancer in an experimental model. The aim of the present study was to investigate the survival benefit of RIT compared with chemotherapy.An anastomosis was constructed in male Wag/Rij rats after intraluminal injection of CC531 tumour cells. The therapeutic efficacy of (177) Lu-labelled MG1 (single intravenous dose of 300 MBq/kg, n = 20) was compared with that of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (6 weekly cycles administered intraperitoneally, n = 20) and no treatment (n = 20). The primary endpoint was survival. Toxicity was monitored by bodyweight measurement.Both chemotherapy and RIT affected bodyweight, but the weight of animals in the RIT group remained significantly higher than in the chemotherapy group (median slope of bodyweight plot 0Â·48 versus 0Â·30 g/day; P < 0Â·001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that overall survival in the RIT and chemotherapy groups was significantly better than that in the control group (50 and 46 per cent versus 25 per cent respectively after 170 days; P = 0Â·024 and P = 0Â·029). Survival after treatment with RIT did not differ from that after chemotherapy (P = 0Â·911).RIT is as effective as chemotherapy in experimental colorectal cancer.

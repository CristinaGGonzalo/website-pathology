## Abstract
Removal of a primary colorectal tumor resulted in an increase in metabolic activity in its liver metastasis. Concomitantly, levels of angiostatin and endostatin in urine and plasma, respectively, dropped. This finding indicates that the primary tumor suppressed angiogenesis in its distant metastasis, and that removal of the primary lesion caused a flare-up in vessel neoformation and, thus, enhanced metabolic activity in its liver metastasis.

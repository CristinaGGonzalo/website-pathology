## Abstract
Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the mouse brain reveals a wealth of metabolic information, not only from a single region of interest (single voxel), but spatially mapped over potentially the entire brain. However, MRSI requires challenging methods before the data can be obtained accurately. When applied in vivo, MRSI is generally combined with volume-selective spin perturbation to exclude artifact originating from outside the volume of interest. To obtain good magnetic field (B (0)) uniformity at this volume, accurate B (0) shimming is required. Finally, the immensely large signals originating from water spins need to be suppressed to prevent sidebands that contaminate the spectra, or even saturate the dynamic range of the MR receiver. This chapter describes solutions for these challenges and ends with a rationale between single-voxel MRS versus MRSI.

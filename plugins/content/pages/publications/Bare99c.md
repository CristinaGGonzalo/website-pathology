## Abstract
Prostate and urinary bladder cancer are the most frequently encountered malignancies of the urinary tract. Appropriate use of the different imaging techniques is crucial for accurate assessment of prognosis and for the development of appropriate treatment planning. Especially determination of local tumor extension and detection of nodal or bone metastases is extremely important. In this regard MR imaging is the most promising imaging technique. Therefore, in this review its role in staging these malignancies is evaluated and compared with clinical staging, and other imaging techniques. Finally, future developments, such as new sequences, new contrast agents, the role of surface coils and MR-guided biopsy, are considered. Also, the preferred radiological approach is discussed.

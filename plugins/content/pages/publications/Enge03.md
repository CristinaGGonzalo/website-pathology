## Abstract
Mammogram registration is an important technique to optimize the display of cases on a digital viewing station, and to find corresponding regions in temporal pairs of mammograms for computer-aided diagnosis algorithms. Four methods for mammogram registration were tested and results were compared. The performance of all registration methods was measured by comparing the distance between annotations of abnormalities in the previous and current view before and after registration. Registration by mutual information outperformed alignment based on nipple location, alignment based on center of mass of breast tissue, and warping.

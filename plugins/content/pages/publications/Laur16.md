## Abstract
A 42-year-old man with a medical history of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension was admitted to the hospital because of slowly progressive shortness of breath and hypoxemia. The diagnosis hepatopulmonary syndrome was confirmed by a pulmonary perfusion scan with 99m Tc-albumin. The scan showed a right-left shunt, because the 99m Tc-albumin transited the lungs and appeared in the brain, the thyroid gland, the kidneys and the spleen. The patient received a liver transplantation, which is considered the only definitive treatment.

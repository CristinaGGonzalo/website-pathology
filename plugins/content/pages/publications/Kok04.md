## Abstract
In this study the possible adverse effects of in utero exposure to magnetic resonance (MR) conditions at 1.5 Tesla were examined. Thirty-five children between 1 and 3 years of age, and nine children between 8 and 9 years of age, that were exposed to MR during the third trimester of pregnancy, were checked for possible adverse effects in a follow-up study. Data on pregnancy and birth, the results of a neurological examination at 3 months, their medical documentary with emphasis on eye and ear functioning, and a questionnaire answered by their mothers were collected and evaluated. In five children abnormal test results were observed, that had no relation to the MR exposure. No harmful effects of prenatal MR exposure in the third trimester of pregnancy were detected in this study.

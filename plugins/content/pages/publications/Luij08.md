## Abstract
A correct histological diagnosis, careful staging and detection of tumour response to treatment are all crucial in the management of sarcomas. Imaging is important in all of these stages. Sarcomas have distinct biological and treatment-related features posing challenges for imaging. For example, size measurements may not adequately reflect response rates. Techniques which can measure tissue function rather than generate merely anatomical data such as positron emission tomography (PET) are rapidly gaining interest. We discuss the importance of imaging in different stages of patient management, emphasising the unique characteristics of sarcoma. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of PET for the various indications, focussing on therapy evaluation.

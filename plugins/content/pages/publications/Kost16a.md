## Abstract
Nondiagnostic cytology is the most important limitation of thyroid ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA). This study aimed to identify factors associated with the adequacy rate of thyroid US-FNA. Consecutive thyroid US-FNAs (2006-2013) were retrospectively included. Attending radiologists, radiology fellows and radiology residents performed US-FNA, usually involving 2-3 needle passes. In more recent years, rapid on-site adequacy assessment (ROSAA) was performed to ensure specimen adequacy. US characteristics, procedural variations and cytology results were extracted from US and pathology reports and statistically evaluated. Diagnostic cytology was obtained in 64.6% of 1,381 thyroid US-FNAs. Factors associated with nondiagnostic cytology were ROSAA (74.6% diagnostic cytology, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.71), ?3 clinic visits for US-FNA of the same thyroid nodule (54.7%, OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.10) and increased intranodular vascularization (51.8%, OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.17-2.57). With ROSAA, an increasing number of needle passes demonstrated improving adequacy rates. The adequacy rate was not operator-dependent. This study demonstrates that ROSAA improves the adequacy rate of thyroid US-FNA. Without ROSAA, we recommend performing at least 3 needle passes. Less diagnostic cytology is obtained from nodules with increased intranodular vascularization or from those undergoing US-FNA ?3 times.

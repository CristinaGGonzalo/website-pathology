## Abstract
The authors investigated the feasibility of a multisection proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging technique for the acquisition of metabolic information in the human prostate. Multisection MR spectroscopic imaging was performed of a citrate phantom and of the prostates of eight adult volunteers. High-quality proton MR spectra and citrate metabolite maps of the prostate were obtained with this method.

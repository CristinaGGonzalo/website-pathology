## Abstract
Using available data for photon attenuation and tissue composition, a computer code was developed for the optimization of the composition of phantom materials for diagnostic radiology. The code allows selection of attenuation data in a photon energy range from 1 to 150 keV and the choice of a suitable weight function in the energy interval chosen. For applications in CT imaging a weight function is available reflecting the contribution of the x-ray spectrum to the CT-signal. Several phantom materials for CT were optimized (body fat, trabecular bone, an average bone composition for C4 vertebrae and water) by varying the mineral components in a polymer base in order to adjust x-ray attenuation properties. Measurements with the water equivalent material (PSPP1) showed good agreement of calculated and measured HU values (AHU = 7.3 +/- 5.3 at 80 kVp and 4.0 +/- 2.7 at 140 kVp) and little variation of HU for tube voltages from 80 to 140 kVp. The method provides a fast and flexible means for obtaining optimized phantom materials for a large variety of tissue compositions and energy ranges.

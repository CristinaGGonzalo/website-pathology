## Abstract
Whereas dilatation of a single stenosis of the main renal artery is a routine intervention, a narrowing of the renal artery at its bifurcation extending into the branch arteries poses a more complex problem. The procedural risks of renal artery dilatation are compounded by the danger of occlusion of one of the branch arteries during maneuvers to dilate the other. Long-term results of surgical vascular reconstruction at a renal artery bifurcation are not satisfactory. Untreated, these stenoses lead to intractable hypertension and impairment or loss of renal function. We present a patient with hypertension and impaired function of the right kidney on account of a renal arterial bifurcation stenosis. Using a bilateral transfemoral arterial approach 2 balloon catheters were simultaneously placed into the origins of the renal artery branches and both arteries were successfully dilated by the kissing balloons technique. This method provides an elegant alternative to difficult surgery to save an endangered kidney.

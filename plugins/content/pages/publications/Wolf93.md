## Abstract
Conformational changes of the oligonucleotides r(A)12, d(GC)5, and d(AT)5 upon binding to a pentacosapeptide representing the RNA-binding N-terminus of the coat protein of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) were studied by using absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The peptide destabilizes the single-stranded structure of r(A)12 at pH 7.2, but disrupts the double-stranded structure of r(A)12 at pH 5.0. However, at pH 4.0, the peptide is not able to disrupt this double-stranded structure. The double-stranded structures of d(GC)5 and d(AT)5 with Watson-Crick base-pairing are stabilized upon binding to the peptide.

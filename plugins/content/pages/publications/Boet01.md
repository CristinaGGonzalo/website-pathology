## Abstract
Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5% to 10% of the total breast cancer burden. Screening of this group of women has been done by palpation and conventional mammography until recently, but because of the age group, mammography has a limited value. MR mammography has been demonstrated to be a reliable imaging modality in this group of patients.

In addition to recognizing excellent research, this award aims at connecting academic research to primary school teaching programs. Prior to and during the award ceremony, the winners were asked critical questions by the students of the participating primary schools. In the coming year, the winners will work on the development of teaching material together with their colleagues, the &lt;a href="https://www.ru.nl/wetenschapsknooppunt/"&gt;Radboud Wetenschapsknooppunt&lt;/a&gt; and teachers. Videos of the interviews and the award ceremony can be found &lt;a href="https://www.ru.nl/wetenschapsknooppunt/activiteiten-voor/radboud-onderzoekers/radboud-science-awards/overzicht-winnaars/winnaars-rsa-2018/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Automatic mitosis detection in breast cancer tissue sections</title><link href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/highlights/mitosis-detection-in-he/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-22T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>WebteamDIAG</name></author><id>tag:www.computationalpathologygroup.eu,2018-08-22:/highlights/mitosis-detection-in-he/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Manual counting of mitotic tumor cells in tissue sections constitutes one of the strongest prognostic markers for breast cancer.

This procedure, however, is time-consuming and error-prone. &lt;a href="https://diagnijmegen.github.io/website-pathology/members/david-tellez/"&gt;David Tellez&lt;/a&gt; et al developed a method to automatically detect mitotic figures in H&amp;amp;E stained breast cancer tissue sections based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system was trained in a single-center cohort and evaluated in an independent multicenter cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas on the three tasks of the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge (TUPAC). The image shows a selection of patches identified by the CNN as containing a mitotic figure. From 181 detections, 128 patches were classified as true positives by a resident pathologist, resulting in a precision score of 0.707. The work was published in &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8327641/"&gt;Transactions on Medical Imaging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>First edition MIDL 2018 great success</title><link href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/highlights/midl18-great-success/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>WebteamDIAG</name></author><id>tag:www.computationalpathologygroup.eu,2018-08-07:/highlights/midl18-great-success/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to everyone who attended &lt;a href="https://midl.amsterdam/"&gt;MIDL 2018&lt;/a&gt; and made this first edition to a great success!

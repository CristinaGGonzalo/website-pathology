## Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe the Prostate Imaging and Reporting Archiving Data System (PI-RADS). For every single parameter the PI-RADS scoring system will be explained and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examples will be given. In the end two patient cases are presented to explain the overall interpretation score in multiparametric imaging.

## Abstract
Local abnormalities of the ascending aorta, especially at the site of correction are well known complications after surgical correction of aortic coarctation. Regular follow-up is therefore necessary. Besides chest X-ray, transesophageal-echocardiography and substraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computertomography (CT) provide a complete and noninvasive examination of the great vessels. MRI and CT are ideally suited for this purpose.

## Abstract
In three patients with catheter-associated candidaemia, use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) led to the diagnosis of Candida lung abscesses, which was confirmed by computed tomography and a favourable response to antifungal therapy. It was concluded that FDG-PET is a promising new imaging technique that enables early identification of sites of disseminated candidiasis, and that this technique can be used in the evaluation of therapy.

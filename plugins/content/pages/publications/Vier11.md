## Abstract
We present a case in which a polypropylene mesh was placed over the posterior vaginal wall and was fixed to the sacrospinous ligaments on both sides. Postoperative a rectal obstruction developed which was only resolved after splitting the entire mesh in the midline. It is hypothesised that the obstruction was due to the fixation of the mesh with irresolvable suture material to the sacrospinous ligaments acting as a hinge on which the bowel folded.

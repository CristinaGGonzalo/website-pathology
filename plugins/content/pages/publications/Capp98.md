## Abstract
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of fetal lamb brain was performed simultaneously with repeated measurements of fetal arterial oxygen saturation during decrease of oxygen supply. Magnetic resonance spectra displayed the same metabolite peaks as detected in the human fetal brain. Cerebral lactate signals could be detected during fetal hypoxia.

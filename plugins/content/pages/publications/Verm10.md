## Abstract
OBJECTIVE: This review is a primer on the technical aspects of performing a high-quality MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging examination of the prostate. CONCLUSION: MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging are useful tools in the localization, staging, and functional assessment of prostate cancer. Performing a high-quality MR spectroscopic examination requires understanding of the technical aspects and limitations of spectral acquisition, postprocessing techniques, and spectral evaluation.

## Abstract
Storage phosphor radiography is a digital technique that uses photo-stimulable, phosphor screens to substitute for conventional screen-film combinations. While the technique is more than 15 years old, it is only recently that technological and economic aspects of these systems have become favourable enough to envisage a more widespread clinical application.

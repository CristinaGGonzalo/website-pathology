## Abstract
The number of cases of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) poisoning is increasing rapidly. The substance is becoming more and more popular as a party drug, while the users are often unaware of the potential dangers of GHB abuse. If a GHB overdose is treated properly and on time, the patient generally recovers completely within 6 hours. Preventing aspiration and the timely initiation of artificial respiration are particularly important.

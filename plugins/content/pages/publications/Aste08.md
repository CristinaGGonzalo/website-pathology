## Abstract
Histopathology of prostate needle biopsies (PNBs) is an important part in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment evaluation of prostate cancer. The determination of metabolite levels in the same biopsies may have additional clinical value. Here, we demonstrate the use of non-destructive high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) proton NMR Spectroscopy for the assessment of metabolic profiles of prostate tissue in PNBs as commonly obtained in standard clinical practice.PNBs that were taken routinely from 48 patients suspected of having prostate cancer were subjected to HRMAS proton NMR spectroscopy. Subsequent histopathology of the same biopsies classified the tissue either as cancer (n = 10) or benign (n = 30).Some practical aspects of this assessment were evaluated, such as typical spectral contamination caused by the PNB procedure. Significant metabolic differences were found between malignant and benign tissue using a small set of ratio's involving signals of choline compounds, citrate and lactate. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between choline, total choline, and citrate over creatine signal ratios and the Gleason scores of tumor in PNBs and of tumor in the whole prostate.This preliminary study indicates that HRMAS NMR of routinely obtained PNBs can provide detailed metabolic information of intact prostate tissue with clinical relevance.

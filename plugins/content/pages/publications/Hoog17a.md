title: Magnetic Resonance Image guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound

## Martijn Hoogenboom

## Abstract
Over the last decades image guided local (thermal) therapies, such as laser, cryo- or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), are upcoming alternatives for radical approaches (surgery and external beam radiation) for the treatment of solid tumors. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging technique and currently the only non-invasive focal ablation therapy. Thermal HIFU (T-HIFU) ablation is widely known and already clinically used for both benign and malignant solid tumors. Next to T-HIFU, the interest in mechanical destruction of tissue with HIFU is growing.

## Abstract
To assess specific clinical criteria in patients with uveitis that are related to signs of sarcoidosis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest.Retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients with uveitis who were referred for chest HRCT because of suspicion of sarcoidosis. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest radiographs and chest HRCT scans were retrieved. HRCT scans were reassessed for signs of sarcoidosis. Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact test were used for data analysis.Ten of 50 (20%) uveitis patients referred for HRCT demonstrated signs of sarcoidosis on HRCT. The median age of these patients was significantly higher than those patients with a negative HRCT (71.1 vs 44.7 years, p=0.002). The presence of peripheral chorioretinal punched out lesions and posterior synechiae were significantly related to an abnormal HRCT scan.Increasing age, presence of peripheral multifocal chorioretinitis and posterior synechiae were associated with an abnormal HRCT scan.

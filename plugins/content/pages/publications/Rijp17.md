## A. Rijpma

## Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 20 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of dementia in older persons.Several life style factors have been identified that can reduce or increasse the risk for dementia or AD, such as diet. This has raised much interest in the role nutrition plays in AD, and whether nutrients or nutrional supplements can effect the course and the pathology of the disease. The research in this thesis explores the effects of nutrients in AD, with a focus on those nutrients that are involved in phospholipid metabolism, at severals levels of this route.

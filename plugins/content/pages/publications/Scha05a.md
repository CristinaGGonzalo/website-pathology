## Abstract
Rupture of thin-cap fibroatheroma is a major cause of acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Identification of these plaques is one of the major challenges in cardiovascular medicine. At present, techniques with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify these unstable plaques are not clinically available. This paper describes a new technique to identify these plaques.Three-dimensional intravascular ultrasound palpography is a catheter-based technique that visualizes radial strain (deformation) of vascular tissue induced by physiological variations in intraluminal pressure. A three-dimensional palpogram of these cross sections can be constructed by performing a continuous pullback of the catheter. Phantom and animal experiments revealed feasibility and good reproducibility of three-dimensional palpography. Increased strain values were observed in areas with reduced cap thickness and increased macrophage accumulation. In patients (n = 2) three-dimensional palpography is feasible and identifies areas with high and low strain.Three-dimensional palpography allows scanning of coronary arteries in patients to identify and localize highly deformable regions.
